This operation failed because the <a class="zem_slink" title="IUnknown" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUnknown">QueryInterface</a> call on the <a class="zem_slink" title="Component Object Model" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model">COM</a> component for the interface with IID '{3050F3F0-98B5-11CF-BB82-00AA00BDCE0B}' failed due to the following error: No such interface supported (Exception from <a class="zem_slink" title="HRESULT" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HRESULT">HRESULT</a>: 0x80004002 (E_NOINTERFACE)).

My first reaction was:"What the hell? HTMLDocumentClass is the managed wrapper of <a class="zem_slink" title="Trident (layout engine)" rel="homepage" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa741317.aspx">MSHTML</a>, and MSHTML is supposed to support the ICustomDoc interface!"

Now I started wondering why the interfaces don't work I created a sandbox project and tried to cast interface there, but it works smoothly. I played with strong name and found no luck. Finally, I found out that it is the frame document that does not support this interface.
