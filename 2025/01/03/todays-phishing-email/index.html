<p>The only help from the email provider is marking the email as sent by mail.txu.com. Which is still spoofed, but nevertheless makes the email suspicious, as the email pretends to be from Apple. There is also a clue in the email itself, the terms of service URL in the email somehow points to Netflix, probably to filter out people too smart to attack. </p><p>More than meets the eye is the sender address, which is base 64 encoded, the biggest red flag. 
The sender address value is =?UTF-8?B?aUPzoIW/86CFv0nzoIW/86CFv2/zoIW/86CFv3U=?= =?UTF-8?B?86CFv/Oghb9k?= mail@txu.com. the parts between =?UTF-8?B? and ?= are base 64 encoded. Translated to plain text as </p>
<ol><li>
69 (small letter i)</li><li>43(capital C)</li><li>F3-A0-85-BF(U+E017F, a glyph variant for a preceding character)</li><li>F3-A0-85-BF</li><li>49(l)</li><li>F3-A0-85-BF</li><li>F3-A0-85-BF</li><li>6F (o)</li><li>F3-A0-85-BF</li><li>F3-A0-85-BF</li><li>75 (u)</li><li>F3-A0-85-BF</li><li>F3-A0-85-BF</li><li>64 (d)</li></ol><p>Basically a fancy writing of iCloud. If you see the font or letter for sender address is slightly off from your usual font in your email, the email is probably not authentic. If you are on a mobile device, zoom in and compare the font of the same letter used in email address and the rest of web page (especially the letters from the email software or web site itself). </p><p>There are more obvious signs. The Return-Path: &lt;T4eN5CKib3yjuft3h35chyeVOw2ZlU2x07OdJR3EkUjBHKhNypSBuUfM@8020inc.net&gt; does not sound very Apple-like either. And don’t get me started with the Subject =?UTF-8?Q?Your_A=E2=81=AEpp=E1=9E=B5Ie_lD_Has_Been?= =?UTF-8?Q?_Di=E2=81=ABsabIed_Pending_Further_Verif?= =?UTF-8?Q?i=E2=80=8Dcation_=2389084003?=, which displays a very urgent message when viewed in email clients, but the spell checker (after clicking Reply) will tell you that the (឵) in A⁮pp(឵)Ie lD is misspelt.&nbsp; </p><p>The less obvious location is the last "Received: from" address, whose value is wqfvOLXVT484537-LOWNshnE41534.mdpmta.sys.comcast.net (ip67-217-244-160.pbiaas.com. [67.217.244.160]), which does not match mail.txu.com's IP 68.232.201.28. Apparently this happens to TXU frequently enough that it has a <a title="https://www.txu.com/fraud-awareness/suspicious-email-alert" href="https://www.txu.com/fraud-awareness/suspicious-email-alert">https://www.txu.com/fraud-awareness/suspicious-email-alert</a> page up telling users about phishing campaigns using their domain name, but TXU really needs to have an active DMARC rejection policy to prevent others from spoofing their address. </p><p>The part that can slip through even trained eye is obfuscated links like href=3D"https://mobile.mail.yahoo.com/apps/affiliateRouter?brandUrl=3Dhttps://www.google.com/amp/t.=. The 3D added before the quote is malformed HTML, browsers will ignore it but spam filters probably have trouble adjust to it. The double redirection from both https://mobile.mail.yahoo.com/apps/affiliateRouter and https://www.google.com/amp will bypass domain based URL scanners as the real attack URL is hidden behind&nbsp; Google’s AMP framework and only get sent by Google when the user clicked the link.

If the target does not match the pretended sender, stop reading.</li><li>Companies that do business with you will know your name and will not address you as “Dear Customer” or email address. A sophisticated cybercriminal will have your name, birthdate, address, phone number, and even social security number, however, so don’t bank on it. </li><li>Companies that do business with you will hire specialist copywriters for their communications. They use formal language and won’t have poor spelling or grammar. </li><li>Don’t panic even when the an email for urgent action to avoid some negative outcome, even more so when asked to click a link. Don’t interact with the email at all. Go to the official information source and verify. </li><li>Use the reply function of your email client/ web site and run the quoted original email through a spell checker before responding.&nbsp; </li></ol><p>Users should remain vigilant for such indicators and verify the legitimacy of any suspicious emails through official channels. In addition, companies like TXU should also strengthen their defenses to prevent email spoofing. This post serves as a reminder for cybersecurity awareness in identifying and mitigating phishing threats.</p></body></html>
