Some more effective replacements can also be composed in chemical labs.</p> <p>GM food can prevent starvation and its side effect is not known clearly. No more effective replacement found.</p> <p>Q(Clone) Why another genetic technology, Cloning, is baned and producing GM food is not?</p> <p>A: Cloning human is baned mainly for moral concern, and this concern does not occur for GM food. </p> <p>Q: The government should deal with public affairs, and GM food production is one. <br />A: The government should deal some but not all public affairs, and restricting GM food production may delay or stop investigation for its side effect and genetic technology advance.</p> <p><br />Q: The government should label GM food on sale.<br />A: It is not our topic. Our topic is wether the government should control GM crop production or not.The Comsumer can refuse the unlabelled products.Almost all GM products are labelled.</p> <p>Q: GM food hurt the env<br />A: I am not sure about this. In fact, it is reported in China that GM corton reduced the use of insectcide and prevented the farmers from diseases caused by insectcide. It have a great advantage of prevention of starvation. And, can u tell me something &quot;harmless&quot;?</p> <p>??Anyway, global warming appears to be a bigger threaten to global ecosystem, since its effects are already discovered.</p> <p>Q: It is good, but it is developing and the gov should supervise the production for safety<br />A: That cost huge budget and make the gov large.</p> <p>?? Why not use the fund to support GM research to ensure its security?</p> <p><br />Why the gov should interven the application of a health developing technology?<br />Is the production of traditional crops harmless to people?<br />Don't you think the consumer should have the right to choose their diet, smoke or drink?The production of tobacco is not controled by gov.<br /></p></div></body></html>
