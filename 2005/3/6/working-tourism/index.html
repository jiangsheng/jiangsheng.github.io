Working tourism in Mozambique is still in the beginning for historical and economical reasons. World Bank reported that “The resource base is seriously threatened by population growth, extreme poverty, poor management and utilization and lack of financial resources.” (Mozambique - Transfrontier Conservation Areas and Tourism Development Project, 2004). These potential working tourism positions distribute in many areas, such as education, infrastructure development and natural and culture conservation development.</font></p> <p style="text-align:left;" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"> </font></p> <p style="text-align:left;" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">First, education positions are needed since local communities have little recognitions of tourism benefits and opportunities. Mr. Albino Celestino Mahumane, the Ministry of Tourism of Republic of Mozambique, reported that Mozambique had a very low level of schooling and “link between these resources and communities is crucial for development in the medium and long term.” (Mahumane, A. C., 2001). Possible positions could be English and Health, because there are many useful academic resources in these fields.</font></p> <p style="text-align:left;" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"> </font></p> <p style="text-align:left;" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Second, positions in infrastructure development, such as roads, airports, telecommunications, water and electricity, health services, should open to attract tourists. To develop tourism in inland area, more transportations and accommodations need to be built while most of these are near the coast currently. (Mahumane, A. C., 2001). Health service is another problem that needs assisting. Again, existing technologies and human resources from foreign tourists can be used to help efforts in these improvements.</font></p> <p style="text-align:left;" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"> </font></p> <p style="text-align:left;" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Last, increasing working positions for tourists in these areas not only help ecotourism projects with financial benefits but also with their skills and experiences. For one, “tourism in Mozambique is based on its natural resources” (Mahumane, A. C., 2001). For another, “Development of ecotourism projects does require cash and a good investment climate and some participants in the seminar felt that there were often considerable difficulties in securing finances for ecotourism projects.”(Seminar on Planning, 2001).</font></p> <p style="text-align:left;" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"> </font></p> <p style="text-align:left;" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">After these analyses, where nature-based and culture-based tourisms are unlikely to have sufficient funds for themselves, working tourism can be a supplement of them. It not only provides assistance for them, but also creates its own attraction in education and infrastructure developing.</font></p> <p style="text-align:left;" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"> </font></p> <p style="text-align:left;" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"> </font></p> <p style="text-align:left;" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Reference:</font></p> <p style="text-align:left;" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">World Tourism Organization, Seminar on Planning, Development and Management of Ecotourism in Africa (March 5-6, 2001). &lt;<a href="http://www.world-tourism.org/sustainable/IYE/Regional_Activites/Mozambique/Mozambique-table-intro-sum.htm">http://www.world-tourism.org/sustainable/IYE/Regional_Activites/Mozambique/Mozambique-table-intro-sum.htm</a> &gt; ,</font><b> </b><font face="Times New Roman">Maputo, Mozambique (March 6, 2005)</font></p> <p style="text-align:left;" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"> </font></p> <p style="text-align:left;" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Mahumane A.
