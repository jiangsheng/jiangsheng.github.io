For one, Rice used to take a great part of Chinese diet, but rice is less ate now before because people are getting rich and have more choice on food, such as meat or fast food. As a side effect, diet foods consumption is increasing. For another, people stopped eating some wild animals because they are frightened by the spread of SARS. A characteristic of Chinese diet culture is that people eat almost all animals, such as monkey, bear, crow, toad, snake, mouse, spider, roach and scolopendra, but after the burst of SARS, people don’t eat them anymore.</font></p> <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></p> <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Second, people changed their eating habits a lot.
