<!doctype html><html><head><meta charset="UTF-8"<title>Self Introduction</head><body><div id="msgcns!1BE894DEAF296E0A!108" class="bvMsg"><p style="text-align:center;" align="center">This is JIANG, Sheng writing. You can call me Jason also. I am a Chinese, normal height and weight. I am staying in Austin, Texas now. </p> <p style="text-indent:12pt;">After graduated from Jilin University, I worked in a software company as software developer in Beijing for several years. I developed several education applications during my years in Beijing. After that, I moved to Texas and now studying.</p> <p style="text-indent:12pt;">My hobbies are limited in indoor activities. I navigate online very often, also read and play computer games in my spare time. I am active in several online communities, such as CSDN community, a huge community of Chinese software developers, Microsoft Newsgroups, Netease Communities, and a couple of other web sites. My activities are focused in Visual C++ programming. I was awarded Microsoft MVP (Most Valuable Professional) in 2004 and 2005 for my contribution in these communities. </p> <p style="text-indent:12pt;">A disadvantage of mine is that, as most Chinese does, I am often silence during a conversation. But I am talkative when I know topic well. I am trying to talk more actively.</p> <p style="text-indent:12pt;">I am good at reading. I am used to read fast, especially when reading Chinese. I finished reading Series of the “The Three Musketeers” (“The Three Musketeers”, “Twenty Years Later” and “Le Vicomte de Braggelonne”) by Alexandre Dumas in one day when I was in university. My fast reading helps me a lot in working and studying.</p></div></body></html>
