For one, in the second graph, the unpaid house work-load increases gradually until the number of children exceed 7, which showed expressed a sharp increase for 7 or more children. Generally speaking, an American woman who has more children would have more house work. For another, according to the third graph, the percentage of American women’s share of paid employment steadily decreases when the number of children increases. That is to say, the percentage of American women’s share of paid employment steadily decreases when unpaid house working gradually increases.</font></p></div></body></html>
