I am also pleased with that the government had assured that the urban park will continue to preserve nature instead of to change it to a tourist site.</font></p> <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">However, I am sorry to hear that the UPJ can not support Urban Park in all forms because it has limited resources. Since maintaining this project need more funds than expected, I suggest that limited, sustainable tourism such as ecotourism and working holidays should be arranged to help the UPJ experts continue to do their best.</font></p> <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Thank you.<br />Jason</font></p> <p></p></div></body></html>
