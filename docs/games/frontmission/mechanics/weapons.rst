Weapons
===============================

Weapons have the following attributes:

* AT: attack damage for each bullet
* DF: defense
* Hit: accuracy
* Range: 1 for short weapons, >1 for long weapons
* Bullet: number of ammunition
* Weight: how much it costs engine output
* Type: weapon type (Melee/Short/Long) 
  
As the :ref:`exp <front_mission_mechanics_exp>` bonus is per hit, generally you should avoid single hit Short and Long weapons (except the secret weapon of course). That means no flamethrower or shotgun. Machine gun or missile launcher only.

For late games, if you haven't done agility exp farming, equip a shield for everyone.
