Weapons (Front Mission 1)
===============================

Weapons have the following attributes:

* AT: attack damage for each bullet
* DF: defense
* Hit: accuracy
* Range: 1 for short weapons, >1 for long weapons
* Bullet: number of ammunitions
* Weight: how much it costs engine output
* Type: weapon type (Melee/Short/Long) 
  
Melee weapons usually come with arms. Some grip weapons are melee but there aren't many good melee weapons - you can do without purchasing any and wait for the drops. Although for truck exp farming, you want weakest grips to not blow enemy up by accident. 

Short weapons are usually bought from the shop. As the :ref:`exp <front_mission_mechanics_exp>` damage bonus is per hit, generally you should avoid single hit Short weapons (except the secret weapon of course). Shotguns are the first to retire as they only have accuracy advantage, but accuracy goes up with Short xp. Flamethrowers and rifles are next as they are single hit. In the end you want machine gun or Vulcan only.

Some weapons are Short/Long hybrid. For the pointblank range, their accuracies are too low (except maybe rifles) when the Short exp is low, and damages are too low when the Short xp is high as they are single hit. For long range battles, accuracy deficits make them unreliable damage dealers. Better than nothing of course (if your engine cannot afford a separate Long weapon on the shoulder that is). 

Long weapons are basically free damage. They need to be reloaded often and cannot be fired at close range. Like Short weapons, you want multiple hit ones other than single hit ones when your Long exp is high. 

For late games, if you haven't done agility exp farming, equip a shield for everyone. Shield defense adds to the wanzer's guarding defense but is useless if guard is broken after the first hit or the unit is stunned. 

The grip/shoulder weapons have their own Hit values but are also affected by the Hit value of the arm. You want a high Hit arm to boost accuracy for grip/shoulder weapons. 

Some arms have integrated weapons. Normal arms come with punch, others like gun or cannon are generally less preferable as they have lower HP and defense in exchange of lowering total weight. Also you cannot equip a Long weapon on shoulder. 

For the OCU side, if you missed the secret weapon in mission 15, you can pick it up again in mission 19, but you need to use Royd to pick up this time.
