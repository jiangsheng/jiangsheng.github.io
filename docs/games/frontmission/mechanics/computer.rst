Computers (Front Mission 1)
===============================
Computers adds accuracy/evade bonus for respective categories. They do not affect damage. Generally you want to use a computer that best fit the :ref:`pilot <front_mission_mechanics_pilots>`'s strength. Except when the best :ref:`exp <front_mission_mechanics_exp>` category is maxed and you still want to level up in rest of exp categories.

If you are only training for :ref:`skill <front_mission_mechanics_skills>` activation in the :ref:`Colosseum <front_mission_mechanics_city>`'s VS fight mode, you want agility computers. 

If you are short on money, build up agility and your attack XP and forget computers for a while. The computers only affect accuracy.
