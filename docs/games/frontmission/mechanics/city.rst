City (Front Mission 1)
========================

City is where battle preparation happens. Although sometimes you stop in a camp, camps are effectively cities for the game.

In a city you can get directions and information for your next mission, socialize and prepare for battle, save/load a game, or exit a city and move elsewhere.

--------------------
Shop
--------------------
.. _front_mission_mechanics_shop:

Here you can buy :ref:`parts <front_mission_mechanics_parts>`, :ref:`weapons <front_mission_mechanics_weapons>`, :ref:`items <front_mission_mechanics_items>` and optionally equip them right in the shop. The owner may also have vital information about the game's progress.

The shop gradually releases newer and better parts as the game progresses. Don't throw your money on tiny upgrades. Wait until you have significant upgrades in the shop. Except you may want to keep some weak weapons for :ref:`trunk exp farming <front_mission_mechanics_exp>` or boost your odds in the colosseum. 

--------------------
Military office
--------------------
.. _front_mission_mechanics_military_office:

Here you receive orders and briefings for the battle and gain intelligence to the enemy. Check the  boss’s data and adjust your setup accordingly. Getting orders is the main way to unlock new battlefields or towns you can move to.

Know your enemy:

* Named pilots and Commanders: delay fighting with them if you can. Once engaged, focus fire. 
* Attackers (Melee): Even in late games and in enemy phrases they can still be disarmed without incident if you have Short Skills. But if left unchecked they can do some serious harm if your units become stunned.
* Attackers (Short): Due to the imbalance of Short skills, they can do serious damage in late games. However, you can still disarm them like Melee counterpart in the player phrase.
* Missileers: Due to their range they can focus on your weakest unit (the supply truck that is). Take them out with your close-range attackers (they suck at close range).
* Tanks and carriers. They are not much of a threat. Use them to :ref:`farm Agility exp and do truck exp farming <front_mission_mechanics_exp>`\ .

--------------------
Bar
--------------------
.. _front_mission_mechanics_bar:

Here you talk to people, sometimes you can recruit a :ref:`pilot <front_mission_mechanics_pilots>` here. 

--------------------
Colosseum
--------------------
.. _front_mission_mechanics_colosseum:

Here you fight for money. You can also lose money, however, if you are not careful (or unwilling to save/load).   

Having one Duel or Guide skill can probably get you a win. You can also remove unnecessary weapons (e.g. if you don't need Switch to win, drop a grip weapon) and downgrade parts to boost your payout odds. Use your weakest pilot e.g. :ref:`Maury <front_mission_pilots_maury_odonnell>` or a newcomer to further boost your odds (provided they have the skill to instant kill) .

As :ref:`skills <front_mission_mechanics_skills>` level up by activation, you can use colosseum fights to level up skills.

Certain pilots are recruited here after a fight. 

* Front Mission 1st: Remake: exp increased

--------------------
Status
--------------------
.. _front_mission_mechanics_status:

Here you check out your current lineup.


--------------------
Setup
--------------------
.. _front_mission_mechanics_setup:

Here you customize your wanzers. This is probably a time-consuming process. The commands are almost identical to the :ref:`shop <front_mission_mechanics_shop>`, except you can only equip things you bought already or found in a battle. 

Your wanzer is powered by an engine in its :ref:`body <front_mission_mechanics_body>`, so the total weight you carry cannot exceed that. The setup window displays a W/P ratio, and if you exceed 100%, you will receive a warning. If you leave W/P ratio very low, however, you will get some movement bonus. 

Melee weapons are usually light. You can even do without those, just use the integrated weapons from the :ref:`arm <front_mission_mechanics_arm>`. Short weapons are of medium weight. Long weapons are the heaviest. 

You can equip :ref:`backpacks <front_mission_mechanics_backpack>` to expand your :ref:`item storage <front_mission_mechanics_items>`. However, if you remove your backpack or switch to a mobile weapon that does not allow backpack, the items somehow stay on you. You can equip more items than your backpack/wanzers allows this way. 

How you set up your wanzer depends on the pilot. 

* Tank/Melee pilots. Prioritize movement and defense. Keep weight/power ratio low. Can be mass trained in some :ref:`platform ports <front_mission_platform_differences>` with the help of a secret weapon. Equip a Shield on shoulder. Movement is essential if the wanzer carries Riff. 
* Short pilots. Those can be mass trained due to a secret weapon. Take the best defensive arms. Machine guns in both grips. Prioritize HP for the body.
* Long pilots. They won't receive counterattacks. You can prioritize power output for body (those rockets are heavy) and Hit for arm. Due to Short being overpowered, most of them can use Short builds as well, except you need more engine output for the extra weight from the added Long weapons. You can even equip a Bazooka or Grenade Launcher on one Arm if you don't feel like running back to your supply truck often.
* Due to every pilot can learn Switch or Double and you need the same type of weapon in both hands to level up those skills, do not mix short and long weapons like those wanzers you have at the beginning of the game.

The rating of the finished wanzer will influence the colosseum odds.

--------------------
Save/Load
--------------------
.. _front_mission_mechics_save_load:

Here you can save or load your game progress. Save often. 

--------------------
Exit
--------------------
.. _front_mission_mechanics_exit:

When you leave town, the map will switch to the overall map of the island. Use the arrow keys to select your next destination and press the A button to confirm and move there.

After moving, a "Selection window" may appear. Select "Into Point" to enter another city or select "Move" and press the A-point to move to another destination.

Even when your default destination is a battlefield (back to back battles happens), you might want to check if you need to come back to a city for save/load, regroup, or go for secret missions in some :ref:`platform ports <front_mission_platform_differences>`.

If you enter a battlefield, you will be asked to :ref:`deploy <front_mission_mechanics_input>` your units.
