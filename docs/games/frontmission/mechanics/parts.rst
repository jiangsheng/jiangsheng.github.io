Parts (Front Mission 1)
===============================
In Front Mission, wanzers can be customized with parts. Parts have the following attributes:

* DF: defense (effective HP = defense * HP)
* HP: hit points
* Hit: Accuracy, only used when a weapon is in grip (multiplied with the weapon's Hit). 
* Engine: power output 
* Move: movement points
* Weight: how much it costs engine output
* Int Weapon: the part's built-in :ref:`weapon <front_mission_mechanics_weapons>`, used when another weapon is not in grip. Some parts allow another weapon (e.g. normal hands with a melee weapon), some don't (e.g. mobile weapons or gun hands) 

Body: provide engine support. When the body is destroyed, the wanzer is defeated and withdraw from the battle. You will get a movement bonus when weight/power ratio is low. When the W/P ration is
  * 90% or higher, no bonus
  * 80%-89% ： 1 movement point
  * 70%-79% ：2 movement points
  * 60%-69% ： 3 movement points
  * 50%-59% ： 4 movement point
  * <50% : 5 movement point
 
You want high HP for tanks and high output for attackers that carry a lot of weapons. 

Arm: When an arm is destroyed, you can not use grip or shoulder weapons on that arm without :ref:`repairing <front_mission_mechanics_commands>`. You want high hit arm for attackers and high HP arm for tanks. 

There are two kinds of hit values on an arm, one is with equipped weapon and one is without. The hit value of the arm affects grip and shoulder weapons. The integrated weapon hit affects integrated weapons only.

Leg: provides movement. When the leg is destroyed, the unit would have very limited movement. Actual range depends on leg type (or lack thereof) and the :ref:`terrain <front_mission_mechanics_terrain>`. Normal legs are usually the slowest except for rivers, rocks and beaches, but they can get up and down multiple elevation levels. Hover does not slowdown in beaches and rivers, and they are faster than others in jungles, woods and rocks, the only drawback being unable to move multiple elevation levels. Tires are usually the fastest on flat terrains, but slow in desert, jungle, river rock and woods. Treads are normally a equal or slower version of tire, but they are a little faster than tire in deserts. 

Backpacks: Can increase item storage and range in additional to power output. 

CPU: increase hit/avoid rate. See :ref:`Computers <front_mission_mechanics_computers>`

Although tanks need high HP legs, usually you just want highest movement ones as they need to run to the front to absorb damage and use items to reduce damage taken.

The most expensive part is usually the best option for everyone, if you can afford that is.
