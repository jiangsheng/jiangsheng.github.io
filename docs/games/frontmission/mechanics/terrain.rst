Terrain
===============================

Terrain has various effects on the battle. The most obvious one is that your wanzers with tank legs and trucks can't go into or out of rough terrains like hills. There are also a few hover type legs that let you cross water easily. 

Terrain also provides cover. This is explained in the NDS port during the OCU tutorial mission, but not in the original. For example, the Jungle or Forest terrains slowdown your movement but provide huge defensive bonuses compared to the Glass terrain. A Soil terrain with snow would provide much less cover than the normal Soil terrain. You can view the cover ranting in the status bar (Ge% in the Japanese version).

There's also an altitude difference. You can't use Short and Melee weapons when the altitude difference is too large.
