Items  (Front Mission 1)
===============================

You can equip items to either heal in battle or have various buffs/debuffs. Backpacks can increase item storage and range in additional to power output. Items can be resupplied when standing next to a supply truck or a wanzer with Riff. 

* Repair S/M/L/SP: repair selected part for 50/100/200/400 HP
* Flash Grenade: enemy unit unable to act, dodge or guard. 50% chance to recover per turn. 
* Smoke Grenade: enemy unit accuracy cut by half. 50% chance to recover per turn. 
* Acid Bomb: For the stage, all parts of the target enemy have defense reduced by 50%.
* Chaff Grenade: Long range attack accuracy to the target ally unit reduced by 50%. 50% chance to recover per turn. 
* B\. A\. Mine: anti-unit mine.  

Long range items are essentially Long weapons, you will get exp by using them. 

The USN route does not have a supply truck, a special backpack would turn a wanzer into one that has similar functionality.
