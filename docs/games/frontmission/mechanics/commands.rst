Commands (Front Mission 1)
===============================

Commands are menu options that popup in various times. For example, in the main screen, you have the following options:
* New Game
* Load Game

Sometimes a command is conditional, for example, the Continue command would only appear if you previously interrupted from a battle and have not restarted with a new game. 

In the battle field, if you have a unit selected, you will then have the command to move or attack. then when you select attack, you have command to confirm target (you can switch target here with L/R), or cancel. 

Most commands are fixed and you cannot miss, some les obvious commands are

* Unit command, when pressing B in a battlefield while a unit is selected 
  
  * Move: back to move mode
  * Use Item: don't select this menu item here, as you can't move after that. 
  * Machine status: show HP for each part, as well as the wanzer's status e.g. stunned, etc.
  * Pilot Status: show pilot's attributes and skills.
  * Equipment View: shows weapons on each part and their ammo. 
* Supply: exchange weapons and resupply ammo. Good for exchange the secret weapon during battle to mass produce Short attackers. Only visible when next to the supply truck. If a unit ends turn next to a trunk and has damaged :ref:`parts <front_mission_mechanics_parts>`, then the damaged parts will be repaired first to 1 HP, then to a percent of lost HP.
* Repair: This command will only be displayed if there is an allied unit adjacent to a unit equipped with Refill. Repair is automatic when ending turn next to a supply truck. Repairing a damaged part is not automatic with Riff.
* Machine/pilot status: you can easily trigger this for your pilots by pressing B when selected, but for NPC/enemies, you need to first deselect your current unit then select the unit you want to check, then press B.

There is no menu when pressing B after selecting an enemy unit, but you can see its range after selecting it. 

Usually you do not want a unit to do nothing, so avoid the End command.
