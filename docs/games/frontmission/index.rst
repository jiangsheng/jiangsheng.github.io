Training Priority
=================
each pilot has a max skill slot value. if the current skills is less than the max skill slot and the hero has more fight exp than the pilot's requirement to get a skill in the category, a new skill will be offered when gain a level. The order of choosing skill is Short>Long>Melee. Tanks do not have skill designed for them. 

Skill upgrades randomly when activated, so colosseum is not just a place to fight for money. After getting a new skill, switch to a pair of PIZ3, F-1 TONFAR or SIEGE (you only care about skill activation, not damage) and fight your clone in vs fights. Lv1 skills suck (e.g. lv1 dual and guide cut your accuracy in half) but lv 4 takes too much time so not worth trying in colosseum. you can exit clone fights at skill level 3.

short
-----

Machine gun is just scary in the game, even Maury can do decent damage when maxed out short exp, which is basically free after you get the secret weapon in mission 15. the first 5 are the only characters that can learn all short skills and are good in short. Prioritize short for them and equip with machine guns on both hands.

dual>switch>speed 

dual gives you much more exp now you can keep destroying enemy arms and legs when they are next to a supply truck for repair. switch gives 100% more dmg while speed gives only 1-3 more bullet - 20%- 60% more dmg on a 5X machine gun.

short lineup in the order of damage:

* Ryuji Sakata: short specialist, good for not much else
* J.J.:second best short. also good at long. 
* Bobby Hopkins:rare double ace in short and long
* Natalie F.Blakewood:ace short and OK long
* Keith Carabell:melee placeholder til Yang Meihua joins. short and OK long afterwards.
* Alder Weiss:better train as short because of the melee surplus in the game.
* Peewie Richburg jr.: no other weapons. supply truck is too important to send to the front line. if money is not an issue (colosseum fight income) then train after battle is decided with the help of flash grenades
* Yang Meihua: :melee placeholder til Gregorio joins. short afterwards. best at melee, but better convert to short as in this game short rules. she comes with double, so only 2 skill slots left. her long damage sucks, may not be a good idea to aim for the guide skill. 
* Lloyd Clive: although an avarge short, learning skills early means more damage in early game. get surpassed in damage output when everyone else learnt their skills though.
* Gentz Weizer:Another Lloyd if not for the serious shortage of skill slots.
* Porunga:a tank that wants to be attacker... and good at neither. 
* Frederick Lancaster: gain skills very slowly (esp. for melee). good bait for enemy missileers though. short is the worse talent for him, and he has the worst short damage in the game, but he can learn 2 short skills which is better than some ace shorts (I am looking at you bobby). besides his melee and long are just slightly better. with short so overpowered in the game, even the worst short in the game gets a nod over melee or long.
* Maury Odonnell : a weak version of Frederick

-----
long
-----
Missles makes up the short range deficit. The only skill can be learnt in this category is guide.

long lineup in the order of damage

* Paul C. Grieber:best long in the game. also double as short because free talent slots. Frederick level short though. 
* Hans Goldwin:second best long in the game.  also double as short because free talent slots.  Frederick level short though. 
* Bobby Hopkins:good missileer and short, too bad not much short skills
* Yang Yeehin:good missileer and short, too bad not much short skills
* Natalie F.Blakewood,Keith Carabell and J.J.
* Lloyd Clive and Gentz Weizer

-----
melee
-----
Melee has high accuracy and damage, but no aiming skill like dual or guide so they waste a lot of exp by destroying the body first. 

double>first>stun 

you can stun with flash grenade which has a 1-4 range, there aren't enough enemies worth stunning anyway, better guard their attacks for agility exp

melee lineup in the order of damage:

* Gregorio Maias:best melee in the game, not good for much else
* Ralph Dian: second best melee in the game, 
* Yang Meihua: convert to short after Gregorio joins. if the above 2 can do short, then they will also be converted. too bad they don't have much potentional in short skills like Yang. 
* Keith Carabell: melee placeholder til Yang Meihua joins. 

--------
agility
--------
Tanks are  not that necessary because melee usually don't carry short or long weapon so they can get high def parts without worrying much about engine overload. agility exp is the hardest to get in this game, though, and hero level formula uses exp from all categories, so everyone needs agility xp. don't bother counterattacking in the game, just guard in the enemy turn.

tank lineup in the order of guarding defence:

* Frederick Lancaster
* Maury Odonnell: useful tank in the stage that Frederick joins the enermy
* Porunga: in the last stage everyone can join the fight so you may want to train him a little.
