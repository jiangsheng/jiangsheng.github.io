After creating a new game, you will be asked to :ref:`personalize <front_mission_mechanics_personalize>` your name and call sign. Then you will enter a battle field. 

The game is centralized on battle with robots (called wanzers in this game) on a stage. Then use the prize money to upgrade units in a :ref:`city <front_mission_mechanics_city>` and fight next one. 

Each stage has a victory condition and a defeat condition. Most of the time, the defeat condition is losing the main character, but sometimes it could be failing to protect a certain NPC or out of time. If you lost in a stage it would be game over. If you saved earlier, you can load that save. 

Each pilot has a wanzer. Although you can customize wanzers any way you want, it is best to build a wanzer to its pilot's strength. For example, if the pilot has Double or Switch :ref:`skills <front_mission_mechanics_skills>`, then put Melee or Short :ref:`weapons <front_mission_mechanics_weapons>` in both hands. If the pilot is good at Long, equip some long range weapons. You want good defensive :ref:`parts <front_mission_mechanics_parts>` on a tank, but you want offensive parts on your attackers. 

Use arrow keys to select options or move target. Use A to confirm and B to cancel. Use L and R to switch pilots. See :ref:`Input <front_mission_mechanics_input>` for more information. 

When a unit is selected, the top of the screen will display information about the Unit. For example, the following two lines

Royd in Shrike Ex - LV 26 HP 107 

FI 9 ST 24 LG 14 AG 23 Ge 40% 

would mean the :ref:`pilot <front_mission_mechanics_pilots>` Royd is riding on the wanzer named Shrike. Royd is lv 26, the wanzer has 107 total HP between :ref:`parts <front_mission_mechanics_parts>` (less total HP does not  necessary mean it is in danger, if the body is intact). The wanzer has fight, shooting and long ranged :ref:`weapons <front_mission_mechanics_weapons>` of rating 9,24 and 14 respectively. The wanzer has an agility rating of 23. The :ref:`tile <front_mission_mechanics_terrain>` Royd is on has a cover rating of 40%.

Keep an eye on ammunition too. You can use the :ref:`equipment view command <front_mission_mechanics_commands>` to check out current ammunition status and the supply command to reload ammunition and change weapons (but not parts) when you are next to a supply truck. 

When destroying an enemy or step on a certain tile sometimes you will find a part or a weapon. Don't let NPC or enemy get it first. 

Being an RPG, probably the most intriguing part is the growth of the :ref:`pilots <front_mission_mechanics_pilots>`. After gaining certain :ref:`exps <front_mission_mechanics_exp>` a pilot will level up and sometimes gain :ref:`skills <front_mission_mechanics_skills>`. It is tricky to choose skills best fit a pilot, however.
