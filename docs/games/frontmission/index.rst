=================
Training Priority
=================

Each pilot has a max skill slot value. if the number of current skills is less than the max skill slot and the hero has more fight exp than the pilot's requirement to get a skill in a category, a new skill will be offered when gaining a level. The order of choosing skill is Short>Long>Melee. Tanks do not have skill designed for them.

Skill upgrades randomly when activated. As there aren't enough enemies to fully level up skills, you can use colosseum to train your skills. After getting a new skill, switch to a pair of PIZ3, F-1 TONFAR or SIEGE (you only care about skill activation, not damage), get your best defensive build (the lower accuracy the better) and fight your clone in vs fights.

Lv1 skills suck (e.g. lv1 dual and guide cut your accuracy in half) but lv 4 takes too much time and not worth trying in colosseum. you can exit clone fights at skill level 2 or 3 depending on your patience. A skill cannot be upgraded without activation, therefore if you want to level up Double or Switch, you need the required type of weapons in both hands. The higher your skill level, the more likely the skill will activate, thus creating a snowball effect. Getting a head start in the colosseum would be a great help for your journey.

Chance to level up when activated:

    * 1/2000 all skills at lv3
    * 1/100 Stun/Double/Dual at lv2
    * 2/100 Switch, Speed at lv2
    * 3/100 Guide at lv2, Dual, Switch, Speed at lv1
    * 5/100 First at lv2, Stun/Double at lv1
    * 9/100 First, Guide at lv1

Short
-----

Machine gun is just scary in the game, as exp adds damage to each round of attacks and multiple rounds of bullets magnifies the bonus. Even Maury can do decent damage when maxed out on Short exp, which is basically free after you get the secret weapon in mission 15. Hint you can transfer the weapon between wanzers using the supply truck. 

The first 5 are the only characters that can learn all short skills and are good in short. Prioritize short for them and equip with machine guns on both hands. In late game you can send tough enemies back for repair with Dual and Switch quickly and let your weaker teammates deal with the rest. 

Dual > Switch > Speed

Dual gives you much more exp now as you can keep destroying enemy arms and legs when they are next to a supply truck for repair. It should be the first short skill to get for faster training (with certain weapon you get hundreds of exp even when miss intentionally) unless there's a skill slot shortage. Switch gives 200%, sometimes more damage while Speed gives only 1-3 more bullet - 20%- 60% more damage on a 5X machine gun. Or 33% to 100% more damage on a 3x machine gun. Due to how damage is calculated, you don't really want a 3x machine gun over a 5x. 

Skill level and effects:

* Dual: lv1: accuracy -50% lv2: accuracy -25% lv3 no accuracy penalty lv max: accuracy 100%
* Switch: lv1: activates 30% of the time lv2: 50% lv3 80% lv max: 90%
* Speed: activates 50% of the time lv2: 60% lv3 70% lv max: 80%. Extra bullets: lv1:1,lv2:2,lv3/max:3

Short lineup in the order of damage:

* Ryuji Sakata: short specialist, good for not much else. Somehow can learn 2 melee skills despite being one of the worse melee in the game. 
* J.J.: second best short. also good at long. Somehow can learn 2 melee skills despite being the worse melee in the game. Joins mission 2. Leaves mission 22. Rejoins mission 25
* Bobby Hopkins: rare double ace in short and long. Can't learn First does not matters much, but can't earn Dual and Speed hurts. After mission 11, stop fight after going to military office.
* Natalie F.Blakewood: ace short and OK long. Joins mission 2. Leaves mission 22. Rejoins mission 25
* Keith Carabell: melee placeholder until Yang Meihua joins. short and OK long afterwards. Joins mission 2. Leaves mission 22. Rejoins mission 25.
* Alder Weiss: better train as short because of the melee surplus in the game. Starts with Stun. Can’t learn Speed. I prefer to learn Dual and Switch instead of Guide or other melee skills as anyone with the two short skills can disarm an enemy in one turn. After mission 5, talk in bar, then move to city Menasa, talk in bar, then fight in colosseum.
* Yang Yeehin: Late to join the party and have to play catchup. Worth the training though. Can’t learn First, Dual or Switch. Joins mission 14.
* Peewie Richburg Jr.: no other weapons. supply truck is too important to send to the front line. if money is not an issue (colosseum fight income) then train after battle is decided with the help of flash grenades/acid. if you have to throw a chaff on him you are in trouble. In the original SNES ROM somehow can learn Speed, probably a bug as it is disabled in later releases. Joins mission 6
* Yang Meihua: :melee placeholder until Gregorio joins. Short afterwards. Best at melee, but better convert to short as in this game short rules. She comes with double, so only 2 skill slots left. Her long damage is the lowest in the game, may not be a good idea to aim for the guide skill. Joins mission 4, talk in military office, then talk & fight in colosseum. Leaves mission 14. Rejoins after mission 14.
* Lloyd Clive: although an average short, learning skills early means more damage in early game. Get surpassed in damage output when specialists learnt their skills though.
* Gentz Weizer: Another Lloyd if not for the serious shortage of skill slots. Starts with Stun and only 2 skill slots. Joins mission 23
* Porunga:a tank that wants to be attacker... and good at neither. Can’t learn Dual or Switch. Joins with Bobby.
* Frederick Lancaster: gain skills very slowly (especially for melee). good bait for enemy missilers though. Short is the worse talent for him, and he has the worst short damage in the game, but he can learn 2 short skills which is better than some ace shorts (I am looking at you Bobby). Besides his melee and long are just slightly better. With short so overpowered in the game, even the worst short in the game gets a nod over melee or long. Can’t learn Stun or Dual. Joins mission 3. Leaves mission 20. Opponent mission 22. Rejoins after mission 22.
* Maury Odonnell : a weak version of Frederick but a useful backup tank for splits. Can’t learn Speed. Joins after mission 9, Leaves mission 10. Rejoins after mission 10

-----
Long
-----

Missiles makes up the short range deficit. Can also weaken enemy before finishing up with short specialists. The only skill can be learnt in this category is Guide. Similar to Dual you can farm exp by aiming for arms and legs when the target is next to a supply truck. Like short weapons, the damage bonus from exp is per hit, which means a 3x missile is better than a 1x in late game. In other games you may not want to send artillery units to the front line, but in this one they got decent short output due to Short being unbalanced in the game and they can get Short skills. 

Guide: lv1: accuracy -50% lv2: accuracy -25% lv3 no accuracy penalty lv max: accuracy 100% bug:90% activation at Lv Last and hasn't been patched with so many platform ports, leading me to think it might be intentional now. 

Long lineup in the order of damage

* Paul C. Grieber:best long in the game. Also double as short because free talent slots. Frederick level short though. Can’t learn First, Double or Speed. Talk in bar after mission 5
* Hans Goldwin: second best long in the game.  Also double as short because free talent slots.  Frederick level short though. Joins after mission 8.
* Bobby Hopkins: good missiler and short, too bad not much short skills
* Yang Yeehin: good missiler and short, too bad not much short skills
* Natalie F.Blakewood,Keith Carabell and J.J. above average long. 
* Lloyd Clive and Gentz Weizer average long.

-----
Melee
-----

Melee has high accuracy and damage, but no aiming skill like dual or guide so they waste a lot of exp by destroying the body first, robbing you the chance of destroying the repaired parts for exp. Besides, you need some combinations of smoke bomb + First +some luck on Stun/Double to avoid being seriously wounded by counterattacks in late game. And that missiles hurt. Throw some chaff on them when closing to enemy. Due to how hard melee gets in late game, it would be best to farm melee exp in early game. just remember don't pick up melee skills unless the skill slot allows one after short/long. That said, if you can't farm exp due to time limits or if you need to defend someone, melee does have advantage by destroying the body first.

Double > First > Stun 

You can stun with flash grenade which has a 1-4 range (can be further extended by backpacks). There aren't enough enemies worth stunning anyway, better guard their attacks for agility exp. Not to mention Stun is often wasted by Double activation. First gives melee units a higher attack priority, but does not really matter unless the counterattacking arm or body gets destroyed in a single turn. 

* Stun lv1: activates 40% of the time lv2: 60% lv3 80% lv max: 90%
* Double lv1: activates 40% of the time lv2: 60% lv3 80% lv max: 90%
* First lv1: activates 40% of the time lv2: 60% lv3 80% lv ax: 90%


Melee lineup in the order of damage:

* Gregorio Maias: best melee in the game, not good for much else. Starts with Stun. Can’t learn short or long skills. Skills start at lv2. After mission 8, fight in colosseum, joins after victory
* Ralph Dian: second best melee in the game. Starts with Stun and Double. No First hurts. After mission 16, fight in colosseum. 
* Yang Meihua: convert to short after Gregorio joins. If the above 2 can do short, then they will also be converted. Too bad they don't have much protentional in short skills like Yang. 
* Keith Carabell: melee placeholder until Yang Meihua joins. Can get Double early but that's all he can learn in melee. He's better in short and long. 

--------
Agility
--------

Tanks are not that necessary because melee usually don't carry short or long weapon so they can get defensive parts without worrying much about engine overload. Agility exp is the hardest to get in this game, though, and hero level formula uses exp from all categories, so everyone needs agility exp. Don't bother counterattacking in the game, just guard in the enemy turn.

The agility exp you get by guarding is scaled to the level at the beginning of the battle, thus if you build agility exp earlier, you will get a snowball effect. The first mission has no lose condition and enemy damage is low, perfect time to build agility.

Tank lineup in the order of guarding defense:

* Frederick Lancaster: insane agility growth rate 
* Maury Odonnell: useful tank in the stage that Frederick joins the enemy and when you need to split.
* Porunga: in the last stage everyone can join the fight so you may want to train him a little.

Issue with truck exp farming 
--------------------------------------------
Enemies do get exp and level up for taking your shots and destroying our parts. Start training on your weakest ones then go with stronger ones. It is best to keep multiple enemies alive (e.g. move away from enemy supply truck and make turn walk to you in turns) so you spread out enemy exp gain.
