Supply
===========

This game has a concept of supply zone which is displayed as a green line surrounding the player's base. It starts at a :ref:`corps HQ  <axis_and_allies_corps_hq>` or a city, and can be extended with other :ref:`buildings <axis_and_allies_buildings>`. Certain generals can also airdrop supplies to create temporary supply zones.

In a supply zone, damaged regiments auto heal over time and its lost units are replaced with brand new ones, provided they are linked to a division HQ.
