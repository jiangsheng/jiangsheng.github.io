Supply (Axis and Allies)
===================================

This game has a concept of supply zone which is displayed as a green line surrounding the player's base. It starts at a :ref:`corps HQ  <axis_and_allies_corps_hq>` or a city, and can be extended with other :ref:`buildings <axis_and_allies_buildings>`. Certain generals can also airdrop supplies to create temporary supply zones.

In a supply zone, a damaged regiment auto heals over time and its lost units are replaced with brand new ones, provided they are linked to a division HQ. 

It is important to take out enemy supply line. Either by bombarding cities, destroying supply depots or Corp HQs. On defense, don't count on city to supply you as they are suspect to enemy bombardment, build a supply chain to the city. 

Some terrains are not suitable for buildings. The Improved Logistics :ref:`upgrade <axis_and_allies_upgrades>` can give you more flexibility in placing your supply buildings, a worthy investment.

Having a city in front of your base is not always a good thing. If captured it now gives enemies a supply line.

Heal only happens when resting. If you assign a regiment on guard duty, they won't be healed.
