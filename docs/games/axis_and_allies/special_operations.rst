Special Operations
====================

.. index:: pair: Axis & Allies; Special Operations

You control a general during battle, and the general would have 4 skills (called special operations in this game). Using a skill costs exp points you gain during battle. You gain general exp for regiments engagement as well as simply running the game. After you use a special operation, it goes into a cool down mode and you cannot use it for some time.
