Special Operations  (Axis and Allies)
========================================

.. index:: pair: Axis & Allies; Special Operations
.. index:: pair: Axis & Allies; Generals


You control a general during battle, and the general would have 4 skills (called special operations in this game). Using a skill costs exp points you gain during battle. You gain general exp for regiments engagement as well as simply running the game. After you use a special operation, it goes into a cool down mode and you cannot use it for some time. 

Generally speaking, in multiple player matches, you want attack generals (nuke, carpet bombing, etc) or economy boost (Lend Lease etc). Those who don't (e.g. having spies) are at an disadvantage.
