Mechanized (Axis and Allies)
========================================

.. index:: pair: Axis & Allies; Mechanized Regiments

The fastest regiment type in the game. Although not the strongest, the mobility means you can rush to control favorable :ref:`terrain <axis_and_allies_terrain>` and can eliminate enemies instead of letting them retreat and regroup. Also good for distraction.

Each mechanized regiment has a mechanized command vehicle as the officer unit, with the rest of the regiment varies depending on the regiment type. The Japanese and USA command vehicles have an acceleration of 8, double of other countries. The USA command car also has +2 defense. 

Mechanized units (including those included mixed in infantry and tank regiments) have the Vehicle :ref:`attribute <axis_and_allies_attributes>` which gives them the following resistances: Gun +40%, Explosive +20%. 

-----------------------
Halftrack Regiment
-----------------------
Halftracks are machine guns on wheels. Great to chase down routed infantries but useless against armor. Generally speaking you should use the halftracks that come with the anti-tank or artillery regiments as there will be less infantries from now on.

----------------------------------------------
Anti-aircraft Halftrack Regiment
----------------------------------------------
Requires Engineer Brigade. The best Anti-air unit in the game with 4 mobile AA guns. Use them to protect vital buildings that you have not shielded with bunkers. Useless to ground threat though. Need to be protected with other regiments or bunkers. If you have excess ammo, you can probably get away with building AA bunkers instead of these.

----------------------------------------------
Anti-tank Halftrack Regiment
----------------------------------------------
Requires Motor Pool. Basically the normal halftrack regiment plus two tank destroyers. With sacrificed speed you get anti-armor. The tank destroyer has the tank attribute which has higher resistance than other mechanized units, as well as paralyzing enemies briefly. The halftracks serve as cannon fodder in tank fights but are somewhat good against infantries. You need two of these to repel a tank regiment. Pretty effective against snipers or armor. With favorable general powers in USA generals, AT halftrack rush can often succeed.

----------------------------------------------
Artillery Halftrack Regiment
----------------------------------------------
Requires Artillery Brigade. Basically the normal halftrack regiment plus two artillery halftracks. Fast artillery when you need it. Only use for light fights, as it lacks the firepower from the armor counterpart. It has morale damage, however, good for driving enemies away. The Japanese has the best Artillery as theirs do higher morale damage. Still too weak for special operations. 

----------------------------------------------
Mechanized Infantry Regiment
----------------------------------------------
Requires both Mechanized and Infantry HQs. Units have normal resistance depending on unit type. Has counter for basically all regiment types, with even a light tank in the mix, good for defending unknown threat. In exchange it sacrificed its speed to the foot soldier level.  

----------------------------------------------
Rocket Truck Regiment
----------------------------------------------
.. _axis_and_allies_regiment_mechanized_rocket_truck:

USSR only, requires Artillery Brigade and Rocket Truck upgrade. It is also mix of infantry, halftracks and tank with a focus on rocket truck. However the rocket truck does large area in half of the artillery range with minimal damage, and has a long reloading cool down, making them unsuitable for defending a single enemy regiment. It is best used on offense as support.

----------------------------------------------
Tankette Regiment
----------------------------------------------
JPN only, requires Motor Pool with Tankette upgrade. It is a hybrid between a commander tank and 4 explosive halftracks, both fast, making it the fastest tank regiment in the game. It does not offer much else, though, use it to repel enemy infantries, as the Japanese infantries have no match against snipers (their best units deal AP damage). Only the command tank deals AP damage, and the rest of halftracks deal Explosive damage, not every effective against armor. It can be built at either mechanized or armor HQs. In terms of resistance the whole regiment has tank resistance, good against infantries and machine gun halftracks but pretty bad against AT weapons. By the time you can mass produce Tankettes the enemies probably already started to replace them with armor.
