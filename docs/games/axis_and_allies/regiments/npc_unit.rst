Non Producible Units (Axis and Allies)
==================================================
Those are units given to you and not produced in your HQs.

----------------------
Aircraft Carrier
----------------------
They are airfields on the water. Requires 5 ammo and 5 oil upkeep. They are defenseless, better grouped with battleships. They cannot not be repaired or healed. Do not lose them. It can be used to deploy :ref:`airborne infantries <axis_and_allies_regiment_airborne_infantry>` as well. 

----------------------
Battleship
----------------------
Long range artillery. Requires 5 ammo and 5 oil upkeep. Better position it so it is parallel to the target vessel. For land bombardment it is enough to clear a beach. It can be used to deploy :ref:`Corps HQ <axis_and_allies_corps_hq>`, regular infantry regiment and :ref:`marines <axis_and_allies_regiment_marine_infantry>`.

They also have a couple AA guns, protecting itself and most importantly nearby air carriers from airstrikes. Still you may need land AA fire as enemies will send more than it can handle. 

----------------------
Transport Aircraft
----------------------

This is the transport plane used to airdrop :ref:`airborne infantry <axis_and_allies_regiment_airborne_infantry>` and various crates from :ref:`special operations <axis_and_allies_special_operations>`.
