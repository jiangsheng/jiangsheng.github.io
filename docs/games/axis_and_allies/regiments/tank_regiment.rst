Tanks  (Axis and Allies)
=================================

Tanks are the most expensive regiments in the game, for good reasons. They have the best firepower and can take heavy damage. Generally speaking you should begin producing them as soon as possible.

Each tank regiment has a commander tank. The tank units (including those mixed with mechanized regiments) have both Tank and Vehicle :ref:`attributes<axis_and_allies_attributes>`, which gives them 60% Gunfire and 40% Explosive resistance. 

--------------------
Light Tank Regiment
--------------------
The basic tank that does not require further structure or research. Good for early halftrack battles and capturing undefended cities. If you can retire them the earlier the better, or you can try not building them at all. You may have to detach them from the HQ to make room for better tanks, before ultimately disbanding them. The Japanese variant has 4 tanks instead of the regular 3.

--------------------
Medium Tank Regiment
--------------------
Requires Motor pool. A balance of cost, armor, speed and firepower. generally preferred over other tanks as the backbone of your army. The Japanese variant has 4 tanks instead of the regular 3. For a very prolonged battle when you are facing heavy tanks and artillery you want to replace them with heavier tanks or artillery. Except the British whose the medium tanks are kinda weak without the tech upgrades and you may as well go without them. 

--------------------
Heavy Tank Regiment
--------------------
Requires Motor pool and Heavy Tank upgrade. Available to all but JPN. Powerful but slow and expensive. Need to group with other tanks to not waste firepower on cannon fodders. Can survive a Nuke. Better with artillery or air support. Only USSR and German ones are good. The others are better off with with artillery.

--------------------------------
Anti-Aircraft Tank Regiment
--------------------------------
Requires Engineer Brigade. Basically a Light Tank Regiment plus two anti-aircraft halftracks. Only half of the AA power of an AA halftrack regiment at the cost of a valuable support slot of your armor HQ. That said, if you need a medium tank regiment and an AA halftrack regiment defending somewhere, you might as well build two of these. If you can afford the ammo upkeep, build AA bunkers and medium tank regiments instead. 

--------------------------------
Artillery Tank Regiment
--------------------------------
Requires Artillery Brigade. Basically a Light Tank Regiment plus two self-propelled artillery, except for the Japanese where they have 3 Medium Tanks. Higher damage than their halftrack counterparts and larger AOE area. Too weak for close range, group them with other tank types for protection. And they have very high moral damage and larger damage area, good for attacking defensive formations. If enemies are supplied by a city, you can also bombard the city center to deny them supply. 

The default attack action would cause the regiment to bombard the front units, usually cannon fodders. Always use the bombard action to target high valuable units when you can. 

--------------------------------
Armored Tank Regiment
--------------------------------
USA Only. Requires Infantry, Mechanized and Armor HQs. Similar to a mechanized infantry regiment, but with more tanks instead of halftracks. Having the same speed disadvantage it is also only good for defense, but more successful against enemy armor.  

--------------------------------
Flame Tank Regiment
--------------------------------
GBR only. Requires Motor Pool with Flame Tanks upgrade. Flamethrower on wheels. With the tank attribute they are high resistant to gunfire, making them serious infantry killers. The damages are too low for anything else, though, even with the morale damage they don't stand a chance against armor. 

--------------------------------
Armored Rocket Truck Regiment
--------------------------------
USSR only. Requires Mechanized HQ, Artillery Brigade and Rocket Truck upgrade. Basically a light tank regiment plus two rocket trucks. With no infantry and other halftracks in the mix, it is much, much faster than the :ref:`mechanized counterpart <axis_and_allies_regiment_mechanized_rocket_truck>`. It is more suitable as offensive support to reduce enemy morale.

--------------------------------
King Tiger Regiment
--------------------------------
GER only, requires Motor Pool, Heavy Tanks and King Tiger Tank upgrades. If you think heavy tanks are too powerfully and slow, think again. King tigers are born for the Blitzkrieg :ref:`special operation <axis_and_allies_special_operations>`. Attack with these and have medium tanks chase down survivors. No need to mention, they also can survive a Nuke. To counter them, use artillery or airpower.

--------------------------------
Mechanized Tank Regiment
--------------------------------
GER only, requires Armor and Mechanized HQs. Basically a Light Tank Regiment plus two anti-infantry halftracks. Good for holding unknown threats until other regiments arrive. 

----------------------------------------------
Tankette Regiment
----------------------------------------------
JPN only, requires Motor Pool with Tankette upgrade. It is a hybrid between a commander tank and 4 explosive halftracks, both fast, making it the fastest tank regiment in the game. It does not offer much else, though, use it to repel enemy infantries, as the Japanese infantries have no match against snipers (their best units deal AP damage). Only the command tank deals AP damage, and the rest of halftracks deal Explosive damage, not every effective against armor. It can be built at either mechanized or armor HQs. In terms of resistance the whole regiment has tank resistance, good against infantries and machine gun halftracks but pretty bad against AT weapons. By the time you can mass produce Tankettes the enemies probably already started to replace them with armor.
