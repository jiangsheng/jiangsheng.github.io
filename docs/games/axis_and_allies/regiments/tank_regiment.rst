Tanks
============

Tanks are the most expensive regiments in the game, for good reasons. They have the best firepower and can take heavy damage. Generally speaking you should begin producing them as soon as possible.

Each tank regiment has a commander tank. The tank units also have 75% Gunfire and 25% Explosive resistance.

The basic tank that does not require further structure or research. Good for early tank battles and capturing undefended cities. If you can retire them the earlier the better. You may have to detach them from the HQ to make room for better tanks, before ultimately disbanding them.
