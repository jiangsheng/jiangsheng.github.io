Formation
=============

.. index:: pair: Axis & Allies; Formations
  
You can control the position of units in a :ref:`regiments <axis_and_allies_regiments>` for different tasks.

For example, the default formation for all regiments is Aggressive. It is best used for defense because when you order the regiment to move, its attack efficiency gradually drops until reaching 75%. The Column formation gets a 25% speed bonus, however after moving its attack efficiency quickly drops to 50%, making it only good for reinforce or retreat. The Assault formation has the best attack efficiency but its speed is slowed by 25%.
