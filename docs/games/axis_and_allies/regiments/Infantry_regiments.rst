Infantry 
==========

The cheapest regiment type in the game, good for early game recons, rough :ref:`terrain <axis_and_allies_terrain>` and defensive battles with the heap of entrenchment.  

Although they are weak, you can improve them with improved machine gun, marksmanship training or entrenchment upgrades. 

Infantry Regiment: Basic infantry unit with a wide range of weapons. In favorable terrains they are hard to deal with vehicles. 

Recon Infantry Regiment: Weakest in the game and lack firepower. May just as well run away from threat with the column :ref:`formation <axis_and_allies_formation>`. Good for capturing unmanned cities. 

Anti-Tank Infantry Regiment: Mostly like the standard infantry regiment except some units equipped anti-tank weapons. The only infantry good against tanks and halftracks. As most of units are still wearing guns, it still needs entrenchment and terrain bonus to hold their own against tanks. 

Artillery Infantry Regiment: Similar to Anti-Tank Infantry Regiment it replaced some gunman with long range mortar, good for attacking fixed defense positions. It also has morale damage, causing enemy to rout even without heavy casualties.

Engineer Regiment: You should at least keep one to repair buildings after airstrikes. They also build bunkers that do not count toward building limit, but you need a lot of ammo to support them. Better sell unused bunkers to save some money. 

Assault Infantry Regiment: USA only. Requires M7 Rifle Grenades upgrade from Artillery Brigade.  It is like replacing the regular infantry in the standard Infantry Regiment with upgraded officers that deal explosive damages, with so little added cost that you should use it instead of the standard one. 

Flamethrower Infantry Regiment: USA only. Requires Motor Pool and Flamethrower Infantry upgrade. Equip 2 soldiers in the standard infantry regiment with flamethrowers. Flames have moral damage, causing enemies to rout much easier. But it is a close range weapon and when losing the two flamethrowers, the regiment is no different from a regular one. 

Anti-Aircraft Infantry: GBR only. Requires Engineer Brigade. It is basically a mix of AA halftracks with standard infantry. If you can spare a regiment limit, this can be used to rotate between buildings, replacing some bunkers. 

Heavy Infantry Regiment: GBR only. Requires Motor Pool and Artillery Brigade. It is basically a mix of everything except AA. In a group they are pretty effective on most enemies, even armored ones. You want something more suitable if one on one.

Conscript Regiment: USSR only. Cheap to recruit and maintain. Although without machine guns, Molotov cocktails are more effective than grenades because many troops resist to explosives. Their rifles are weak, however. You need mass recruit before making a move. Perfect meat shield for your artillery or snipers.

Sniper Infantry Regiment: USSR only. Requires Sniper Rifles upgrade. Sniper shots have very high damage to infantry, can one shot any infantry unit, but must infantry regiments consist of many such units. The very low rate of fire from the sniper means not enough firepower in the regiment for the counter attack. Best paired with other regiments. 

Goliath Infantry Regiment: GER only. Requires Motor Pool and Goliath Remote Bombs upgrade. A manned remote control bomb. Although having bonus damage to buildings, the bombs need to be constantly resupplied, which means it is usually assigned to defend enemy vehicles.
