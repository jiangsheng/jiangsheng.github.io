Infantry 
==========

.. index:: pair: Axis & Allies; Infantry Regiments

---------------------
Infantry
---------------------

The cheapest regiment type in the game, good for early game recons, rough :ref:`terrain <axis_and_allies_terrain>` and defensive battles with the heap of entrenchment. 
Although they are relatively weak, you can improve them with improved machine gun, marksmanship training or entrenchment :ref:`upgrade <axis_and_allies_upgrades>`. 

All infantry units (including those mixed within mechanized and armor regiments) have the Infantry `attribute <axis_and_allies_attributes>` that gives them +20% AP Resistance. They also have one infantry officer in the regiment.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Infantry Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Basic infantry unit with a wide range of weapons. In favorable terrains and entrenched they are hard to deal with. 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Recon Infantry Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Weakest in the game and lacks firepower.  May just as well run away from threat with the column :ref:`formation <axis_and_allies_formation>`. Good for capturing unmanned cities. Comes with the recon attribute, +12 visibility, +3 current morale.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Anti-Tank Infantry Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Requires Motor Pool. Mostly like the standard infantry regiment except some units equipped anti-tank weapons. The only infantry good against tanks and halftracks. As most of units are still carrying guns, it still needs entrenchment and terrain bonus to hold their own against tanks.  

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Artillery Infantry Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Requires Artillery Brigade. Similar to Anti-Tank Infantry Regiment it replaced some gunman with long range mortar, good for attacking fixed defense positions like bunkers. It also has morale damage, causing enemy to rout even without heavy casualties.

.. _axis_and_allies_regiments_engineer:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Engineer Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You should at least keep one to repair buildings after airstrikes. They also build bunkers that do not count toward building limit, but you need a lot of ammo to support them. Better sell unused bunkers to save some money. 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Assault Infantry Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
USA only. Requires M7 Rifle Grenades upgrade from Artillery Brigade. It is like replacing the regular infantry in the standard Infantry Regiment with upgraded officers that deal explosive damages, with so little added cost that you should use it instead of the standard one. 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Flamethrower Infantry Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
USA only. Requires Motor Pool and Flamethrower Infantry upgrade. Equip 2 soldiers in the standard infantry regiment with flamethrowers. Flames have moral damage, causing enemies to rout much easier. But it is a close range weapon and when losing the two flamethrowers, the regiment is no different from a regular one. 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Anti-Aircraft Infantry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
GBR only. Requires Engineer Brigade. It is basically a mix of AA halftracks with standard infantry. If you can spare a regiment limit, this can be used to rotate between buildings, replacing some bunkers. 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Heavy Infantry Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
GBR only. Requires Motor Pool and Artillery Brigade. It is basically a mix of everything except AA. In a group they are pretty effective on most enemies, even armored ones. You want something more suitable if one on one.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Conscript Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
USSR only. Cheap to recruit and maintain. Although without machine guns, Molotov cocktails are more effective than grenades because many troops resist to explosives. Their rifles are weak, however. You need mass recruit before making a move. Perfect meat shield for your artillery or snipers.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Sniper Infantry Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
USSR only. Requires Sniper Rifles upgrade. Sniper shots have very high damage to infantry, can one shot any infantry unit, but must infantry regiments consist of many such units. The very low rate of fire from the sniper means not enough firepower in the regiment for the counter attack. Best paired with other regiments. 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Goliath Infantry Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
GER only. Requires Motor Pool and Goliath Remote Bombs upgrade. A manned remote control bomb. As the explosive charge surprisingly does not do explosive damage but AP damage, there success depends on how fast they can run into enemy armor, thus don't send them in unfavorable :ref:`terrains <axis_and_allies_terrain>`.  Although having bonus damage to buildings, the bombs need to be constantly resupplied, which means it is usually assigned to defend enemy vehicles. 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Banzai Infantry Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
JPN only. Requires Artillery Brigade and Banzai Infantry upgrade. Basically base infantry mixed with WWII era suicide bombers, a human version of Goliath. As the explosive charge surprisingly does not do explosive damage but AP damage, there success depends on how fast they can run into enemy armor, thus don't send them in unfavorable :ref:`terrains <axis_and_allies_terrain>`. After the suicide bombers die, it would be as useful as a recon infantry regiment, so it needs to be constant resupplied too, best if used in a defense role. A couple of these can be used to deter a tank regiment.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Commando Infantry Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
JPN only. Requires Sniper Rifles upgrade. Japanese version of sniper, cheaper but shorter range. Like the USSR one, this one is best paired with other regiments to avoid retaliation. 

-------------------------------
Airborne Infantry
-------------------------------

.. _axis_and_allies_regiment_airborne_infantry:

.. index:: pair: Axis & Allies; Airborne Infantry Regiments

Airborne Infantries are generally stronger but come with a cost. Do not just throw them in the dark. They can only be attached to Airborne Infantry HQs. 

All airborne infantry regiments have +25% resistance for Armor Piercing and Explosive weapons. They also usually have one airborne infantry as the officer in the regiment that is stronger than the regular infantry officer.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Airborne Infantry Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Although they are basically stronger of officers with better explosives, lack of machine gun is very noticeable against other infantries. Best to capture remote defenseless cities or as plugin defense until regular regiments arrive. 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Airborne Heavy Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Requires Artillery Brigade. With two machine guns and a mortar, It can stand one on one with other infantries. Still you don't want to throw them into regular battles as they are way too expensive. You want to drop them to destroy high value targets like unguarded depots. 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SAS Commandos
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
GBR only. Requires airfield with SAS Paratroopers upgrade. Has one SAS Commando as the officer instead of the regular airborne infantry. The machine guns and especially two snipers gives the regiments unmatched advantage over other infantries. However they are still way too expensive for regular battles. Use them to capture lightly defended cities or use as instant defense against infantries. 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Airborne Banzai Infantry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
JPN only. Requires Artillery Brigade. Airdropped suicide bombers sounds good on paper but being airdropped means they do not usually benefit from supplies like their ground counterparts. And only two Banzai infantry in them means the explosive charges are very limited. Best used against unguarded high value targets, like airfields or depot.

-------------------------------
Marine Regiment
-------------------------------

.. _axis_and_allies_regiment_marine_infantry:

Marine Regiments are deployed from battleships, not Infantry HQs. They must be attacked to Infantry HQs manually for supply.
