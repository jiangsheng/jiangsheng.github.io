==========

.. index:: pair: Axis & Allies; Infantry Regiments

---------------------
Infantry
---------------------

The cheapest regiment type in the game, good for early game recons, rough :ref:`terrain <axis_and_allies_terrain>` and defensive battles with the heap of entrenchment. 
Although they are relatively weak, you can improve them with improved machine gun, marksmanship training or entrenchment :ref:`upgrade <axis_and_allies_upgrades>`. 

All infantry units (including those mixed within mechanized and armor regiments) have the Infantry `attribute <axis_and_allies_attributes>` that gives them +20% AP Resistance. They also have one infantry officer in the regiment.

Tech up when you have 2 full infantry HQs. Even if you are not doing early game rush, the cities you captured in early game will help you up in higher level battles. With maybe the exception being high startup fund multiplayer games.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Infantry Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Basic infantry unit with a wide range of weapons. In favorable terrains and entrenched they are hard to deal with. As recons take the cap slot in early game and armor in late them, regular infantries see limited usage, especially when the enemies have mortars, snipers or :ref:`special operation bombs <axis_and_allies_special_operations>`. For example despite the British has the best machine gun in the regular Infantry Regiment, their SAS commandos are much better if can afford the research.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Recon Infantry Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Weakest in the game and lacks firepower. May just as well run away from threat with the column :ref:`formation <axis_and_allies_formation>`. Good for capturing unmanned cities, accumulate general exp for special operations and defend them with entrenchment :ref:`bonus <axis_and_allies_attributes>` against other recons. Comes with the recon attribute, +12 visibility, +3 current morale. The morale bonus is actually counterproductive, as you usually want them to rout fast to heal up somewhere else. They heal faster than other infantries with the smaller 5 person squad. They also come out of tent with fully squads, if your base in trouble this might be the fastest way to pump out regiments, except maybe against snipers, the small squad make them easier to wipe out. In late game you want stronger units, but recons can still have their use as scout and cannon fodder for artillery. 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Anti-Tank Infantry Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Requires Motor Pool. Mostly like the standard infantry regiment except some units equipped anti-tank weapons. The only infantry good against tanks and halftracks. As most of units are still carrying guns, it still needs entrenchment and terrain bonus to hold their own against tanks. And don't bother building it against snipers. The Germans have the best ones as theirs have higher rate of fire. The USA ones have lower rate of fire than anyone else, despite their higher damage. If not for the defense upgrades theirs would be the worst one - which is actually the British variant as they lack upgrades.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Artillery Infantry Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Requires Artillery Brigade. Similar to Anti-Tank Infantry Regiment it replaced some gunman with long range mortar, good for attacking fixed defense positions like bunkers. It also has morale damage, causing enemy to rout even without heavy casualties or freeze when attacked, making enemies much easier to be chased and wiped out. The Japanese have the best of those, as their mortars deal 1.0 moral damage instead of the standard 0.75, on top of a +5 damage on their mortar. You want to upgrade their attack speed as fast as you can afford. The airdropped version is Airborne Heavy Infantry. The Germany variant has 2 MG infantries, probably their best infantry regiment. For the British, this gets overshadowed by their SAS Commando.

.. _axis_and_allies_regiments_engineer:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Engineer Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You should at least keep one to repair buildings after airstrikes. They also build bunkers that do not count toward building limit, but you need a lot of ammo to support them. Better sell unused bunkers to save some money. But generally you want to spam HQs to get :ref:`economy <axis_and_allies_economy>` going so this is a late game unit. In early games only the corps HQ is worth repairing, the rest can just burn down to ashes. 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Assault Infantry Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
USA only. Requires M7 Rifle Grenades upgrade from Artillery Brigade. It is like replacing the regular infantry in the standard Infantry Regiment with upgraded officers that deal explosive damages, with so little added cost that you should use it instead of the standard one. They are expensive, so avoid them against snipers. 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Flamethrower Infantry Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
USA only. Requires Motor Pool and Flamethrower Infantry upgrade. Equip 2 soldiers in the standard infantry regiment with flamethrowers. Flames have moral damage, causing enemies to rout much easier. But it is a close range weapon and when losing the two flamethrowers, the regiment is no different from a regular one. As USA is stronger in vehicles and air, investing in the upgrade is questionable.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Anti-Aircraft Infantry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
GBR only. Requires Engineer Brigade. It is basically a mix of AA halftracks with standard infantry. If you can spare a regiment limit, this can be used to rotate between buildings, replacing some bunkers. 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Heavy Infantry Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
GBR only. Requires Motor Pool and Artillery Brigade. It is basically a mix of various weapon types except AA. In a group they are pretty effective on most enemies, even armored ones. You want something more suitable if one on one or against snipers. 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Conscript Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
USSR only. Cheap to recruit and maintain. Although without machine guns, Molotov cocktails are more effective than grenades because it deals flame damage, and nobody resist to it. Their rifles are weak, however. You need mass recruit before making a move. Perfect meat shield for your artillery or snipers, or against enemy snipers. Besides recon you want 3:1 advantage to start a fight. This is a unit good for infantry rush. The windows of opportunity is small, however. 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Sniper Infantry Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
USSR only. Requires Sniper Rifles upgrade. Sniper shots have very high damage to infantry, can one shot any infantry unit, but must infantry regiments consist of many such units. The very low rate of fire (one shot every 10 seconds) from the sniper means not enough firepower in the regiment for the counter attack. The support group are easily slaughtered by SAS or even the MG units in Japanese commandos. Best paired with other regiments. Spamming snipers is a way to go in early game, though. In groups they can kill an infantry regiment instant without the possibility to retreat and heal. Snipers are too slow, however. You can use the retreat command with the direction to enemies occasionally when you have high morale. In late game they are good to protect your cities or base against airdrops before you bunker up.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Goliath Infantry Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
GER only. Requires Motor Pool and Goliath Remote Bombs upgrade. A manned remote control bomb. As the explosive charge surprisingly does not do explosive damage but AP damage, there success depends on how fast they can run into enemy armor, thus don't send them in :ref:`terrains <axis_and_allies_terrain>` unfavorable to tanks (Goliath B1 is actually a small tank).  Although having bonus damage to buildings, the bombs need to be constantly resupplied, which means it is usually assigned to defend enemy vehicles. After the bombs are used, retreat to a supplied zone to get more, they are useless otherwise.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Banzai Infantry Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
JPN only. Requires Artillery Brigade and Banzai Infantry upgrade. Basically base infantry mixed with WWII era suicide bombers, a human version of Goliath. As the explosive charge surprisingly does not do explosive damage but AP damage, there success depends on how fast they can run into enemy armor, thus don't send them in unfavorable :ref:`terrains <axis_and_allies_terrain>`. After the suicide bombers die, it would be as useful as a recon infantry regiment, so it needs to be constant resupplied too, best if used in a defense role. A couple of these can be used to deter a tank regiment.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Commando Infantry Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
JPN only. Requires Sniper Rifles upgrade. Japanese version of sniper, cheaper but shorter range. Like the USSR one, this one is best paired with other regiments to avoid retaliation. You want 3 of these against a SAS Commando regiment. You will soon run out of unit cap if enemies have a lot of elite infantries so better switch to vehicles soon.


-------------------------------
Airborne Infantry
-------------------------------
.. _axis_and_allies_regiment_airborne_infantry:

.. index:: pair: Axis & Allies; Airborne Infantry Regiments

Airborne Infantries are generally stronger but come with a cost. Do not just throw them in the dark. They can only be attached to Airborne Infantry HQs. 

All airborne infantry regiments have the infantry attribute which gives them +20% resistance for Armor Piercing. They also usually have one airborne infantry as the officer in the regiment that is stronger than the regular infantry officer.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Airborne Infantry Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Although they are basically stronger of officers with better explosives, lack of machine gun is very noticeable against other infantries. Best to capture remote defenseless cities or as plugin defense until regular regiments arrive. 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Airborne Heavy Regiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Requires Artillery Brigade. With two machine guns and a mortar, It can stand one on one with other infantries. Still you don't want to throw them into regular battles with vehicles as they are way too expensive, except maybe the cheaper Japanese version. You want to drop them to destroy high value targets like unguarded depots. For troops, they are slower moral killers as they have only one mortar per squad instead of two for the ground version. They can hold their own one on one in cities against most vehicles. They are best infantry against vehicles.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SAS Commandos
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
GBR only. Requires airfield with SAS Paratroopers upgrade. Has one SAS Commando as the officer instead of the regular airborne infantry. The machine guns and especially two snipers gives the regiments unmatched advantage over other infantries. However they are still way too expensive for regular battles. Use them to capture lightly defended cities or use as instant defense against infantries. They are the second best infantry against vehicles.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Airborne Banzai Infantry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
JPN only. Requires Artillery Brigade. Airdropped suicide bombers sounds good on paper but being airdropped means they do not usually benefit from supplies like their ground counterparts. And only two Banzai infantry in them means the explosive charges are very limited. Best used against unguarded high value targets, like airfields or depot.

Marine Regiments are deployed from battleships, not Infantry HQs. They must be attacked to Infantry HQs manually for supply.
