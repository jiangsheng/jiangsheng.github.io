The corps HQ is the most important structure. Without it you cannot produce other buildings. Protect it at all costs, especially in truck mode. 

Although you can use the :ref:`Corps Reorganization <axis_and_allies_special_operations>` special operation to summon another, it takes a long time to meet the exp requirement. 

Destroying enemy corps HQ would cut off their supplies, making the battle much easier. However even the atomic bomb alone won't destroy it. You need some additional forces to finish it off.

Corp HQ is also one of the places where you research your :ref:`upgrades <axis_and_allies_upgrades>`.
