Bunkers
============

Bunkers are defensive structures built by :ref:`engineers <axis_and_allies_regiment_infantry>`.

Generally speaking, you should use infantry instead of bunkers. Infantry can move and can gain ranks and upgrades. Bunkers are weak and take a lot of ammo. Only use bunkers when your regiments are better used elsewhere or you are worried about the regiment limit. Except the anti-aircraft bunker of course. 

Bunkers have a limited firing arc and rotate very slowly, click and hold left mouse button when deploying to adjust directions. 

Bunker: anti-infantry pill boxes. They have a single machine gun but has a lot of HP. Can be used to delay enemy advance until your regiments arrive. 

Anti-Aircraft Bunkers: you want to defend your important :ref:`economy <axis_and_allies_economy>` buildings from air strikes. Build a line of defense after studying the flight path. As they will get hit by escorts, make sure :ref:`engineers <axis_and_allies_regiments_engineer>` are nearby to repair damages.

Artillery Bunker: when your armor is not available you probably resort to bunkers. But they have very slow rate of fire, you need 3-4 to counter a single enemy armor regiment. Always build Bunkers as meat shields before them.
