   Corps HQ <corps_hq>

Buildings
==========
In this game buildings are generally built from trucks. As they are mostly mobile structures, you can usually pack up buildings and deploy them elsewhere. In truck mode a building can move just like normal troops. 

Some buildings generate :ref:`resources <axis_and_allies_economy>` in addition to deploying :ref:`regiments <axis_and_allies_regiments>`. Some buildings cost resources, however.

Building take damage and some buildings have weapons. :ref:`Engineers <axis_and_allies_engineer>`  can be used to repair buildings. 

There is a building limit but certain type of buildings don't count toward the limit.

-------------
The corps HQ 
-------------

The :ref:`corps HQ  <axis_and_allies_corps_hq>` serves as the builder of buildings and the base of the :ref:`supply <axis_and_allies_supply>` zone in this game. You can build other buildings as trucks here. Losing it means you can no longer build new structures, unless in the games that allows the special operation :ref:`Corps Reorganization <axis_and_allies_special_operations>`.


-------------
Division HQs
-------------

Here you recruit :ref:`regiments <axis_and_allies_regiments>`. New regiments are linked to its recruiting Division HQ by default. When attacked, a regiment can be supplied while in the supply zone. Once a Division HQ has the maximum linked regiments, it cannot recruit more. You can detach some regiments to get around this, but unsupplied regiments are at such a big disadvantage that it is much better just to buy another Division HQ. 

Division HQs are also supply line extenders, although they cannot start a supply zone themselves. If the supply line is cut to the division HQ, the linked units would be out of supply too. 

-------------
Supply Depots
-------------
When your army scatter around the map, it will be harder and harder to keep them supplied. You will need to extend your supply zone closer to the front line using supply depots. They are defenseless, and the enemy knows this, you can put some bunkers, troops or HQs around for protection.
