In this game buildings are generally deployed from trucks. As they are mostly mobile structures, you can usually pack up buildings and deploy them elsewhere. In truck mode a building can move just like normal troops. But they will have reduced production, health, defense and no offense capabilities.

Some buildings generate :ref:`resources <axis_and_allies_economy>` in addition to deploying and  :ref:`supplying <axis_and_allies_supply>` :ref:`regiments <axis_and_allies_regiments>`. Some buildings cost resources in upkeep, however.

Building can take damage and some buildings have weapons. :ref:`Engineers <axis_and_allies_regiments_engineer>` can be used to repair buildings. 

There is a building limit that caps the number of most buildings you can build but certain type of buildings don't count toward the limit.

-------------
The Corps HQ 
-------------
.. _axis_and_allies_corps_hq:

The :ref:`Corps HQ  <axis_and_allies_corps_hq>` serves as the builder of building and the base of the :ref:`supply <axis_and_allies_supply>` zone in this game. You can build other buildings as trucks here. Losing it means you can no longer build new structures except :ref:`bunkers <Bunkers>`. Although you can use the :ref:`Corps Reorganization <axis_and_allies_special_operations>` special operation to summon another, it takes a long time to meet the exp requirement. It is the most important structure. Protect it at all costs, especially in truck mode.  

Destroying enemy corps HQ would cut off their supplies, making the battle much easier. However even the most powerful weapon, the atomic bomb, won't destroy it alone. You need some additional forces to finish it off.

Corp HQ is also one of the places where you research your :ref:`upgrades <axis_and_allies_upgrades>`. 


-------------
Division HQs
-------------

Here you recruit :ref:`regiments <axis_and_allies_regiments>`. New regiments are linked to its recruiting Division HQ by default. When attacked, a regiment can be supplied while in the supply zone. Once a Division HQ has the maximum linked regiments, it cannot recruit more. You can detach some regiments and reattch after supplying to get around this, but rotating regiments for supplies is such a big hussle that it is much better just to buy another Division HQ. 

Division HQs are also supply line extenders, although they cannot start a supply zone themselves. If the supply line is cut to the division HQ, the linked units and nearby buildings would be out of supply too. 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Infantry HQ
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Infantry HQ is the HQ to recruit :ref:`infantry <axis_and_allies_regiment_infantry>`. It is also the cheapest way to boost income even when you don't really need more infantries.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Airborne Infantry HQ
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. _axis_and_allies_airborne_infantry_hq:

Airborne Infantry HQ is the HQ to recruit :ref:`airborne infantry <axis_and_allies_regiment_airborne_infantry>`. The deployment is airdropped, usually to enemy controlled area and the :ref:`transport plane <axis_and_allies_regiment_npc>` is suspectable to shoot down. Best to scout target area with recon air missions or :ref:`special operations <axis_and_allies_special_operations>` before deployment. 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Mechanized  HQ
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Requires Infantry HQ. Mechanized HQ is the HQ to recruit :ref:`halftracks <axis_and_allies_regiment_mechanized>`. It generates some more resources than Infantry HQ.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Armor HQ
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Requires Mechanized HQ. Mechanized HQ is the HQ to recruit :ref:`tanks <axis_and_allies_regiment_tank>`. It generates some more resources than Mechanized HQ.

Except for the Germans, each Armor HQ can only supply 3 regiments. The Germans variant can support 4. 

-------------
Supply Depots
-------------
When your army scatter around the map, it will be harder and harder to keep them supplied. You will need to extend your supply zone closer to the front line using supply depots. They are defenseless, and the enemies know this, you can put some bunkers, troops or HQs around for protection.

-------------
Bunkers
-------------

Bunkers are defensive structures built by :ref:`engineers <axis_and_allies_regiment_infantry>`.

Generally speaking, you should use infantry instead of bunkers. Infantry can move and can gain ranks and upgrades. Bunkers are stationary, weak in firepower and take a lot of ammo. Only use bunkers when your regiments are better used elsewhere or you are worried about the regiment limit. Except the anti-aircraft bunker of course. 

Bunkers have limited firing arcs and rotate very slowly, click and hold left mouse button when deploying to adjust directions. 

^^^^^^^^
Bunker
^^^^^^^^
Anti-infantry pill boxes. They have a single machine gun but has a lot of HP. Can be used to delay enemy advance until your regiments arrive. 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Anti-Aircraft Bunkers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You want to defend your important :ref:`economy <axis_and_allies_economy>` buildings from air strikes. Build a line of defense after studying the flight path. As they will get hit by escorts, make sure :ref:`engineers <axis_and_allies_regiments_engineer>` are nearby to repair damages.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Artillery Bunker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When your armor is not available you probably resort to bunkers. But they have very slow rate of fire, you need 3-4 to counter a single enemy armor regiment. They do morale damage and can cause enemies to rout, though. Always build Bunkers as meat shields before them.
