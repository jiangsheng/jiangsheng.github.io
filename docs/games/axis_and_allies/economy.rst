Economy
============

Unlike most RTS games, there isn't a resource gatherer unit in this game. Instead, resources are mostly generated by :ref:`buildings <axis_and_allies_buildings>`. Capturing cities or enemy resource stashes can grant additional income. Resources are displayed on the resource bar. x(+y) means you have x right now, and will generate y in the next minute. 

Each :ref:`regiments <axis_and_allies_regiments>` and some buildings will cost you upkeep in ammo and sometimes oil. If you go to negative in the two resources, it will cost your a lot of money. The money drain will be displayed on the resource bar as negative income. It might be cheaper to just disband a costly unit or sell an unused bunker. It is not really beneficial to keep a huge surplus in ammo and oil, however. 

If your money is in the red, your regiments outside of the :ref:`supply <axis_and_allies_supply>` zone, will be taking damage until they self disband (retreat immediately!), and your regiments inside will be supplied much slower than normal. You can also use this to your advantage by destroying Ammo and Oil depots. 

Capturing a city or building a new HQ will get you additional income. The enemies are going to take city for their own, however. Bombarding a city with artillery can cause enemies in the city to lose supply. In multiple player cities can be crucial to your success as you get extra income, zone of supply and ammo/oil. To delay a city being captured by larger forces, run your troops in circles. The longer the income is denied the better. 

Generally speaking you should build more HQs than necessary so when your finish your tech buildings, you have enough money, to make them useful. A newbie mistake is to build tech buildings first. You also need enough ammo and oil for the regiments to make tech upgrades useful, in multiple players if you are not going for an early game rush, the building slots better go to HQs than oil and ammo depots. use supply trucks to make up the difference. The Germans have higher ammo and oil productions on their buildings, but their slow start make the difference moot, as others can build more supply trucks instead. Although Airborne HQs do not produce oil, the flexibility they provide are worth the extra supply trucks you may need to build.

The USA has the best economy as all of its HQs produce +30 income except airborne (avoid it in multiple player if you can). The Japanese can match USA as all its buildings provide +30 income after the Military Surplus upgrade. The British has a lower eco but it has cheaper buildings. Russia has tank production upgrade making tanks cheaper. And there's the poor Germany hmm, maybe the teammate can spare some money?
