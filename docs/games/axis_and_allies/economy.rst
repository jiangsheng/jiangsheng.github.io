Economy
============

Unlike most RTS games, there isn't a resource gatherer unit in this game. Instead, resources are mostly generated by :ref:`bases <axis_and_allies_buildings>`. Capturing cities or enemy resource stashes can grant additional income. Resources are displayed on the resource bar. x(+y) means you have x right now, and will generate y in the next minute. 

Each :ref:`regiments <axis_and_allies_regiments>` and some buildings will cost you upkeep in ammo and sometimes oil. If you go to negative in the two resources, it will cost your a lot of money that you 'd better spend in purchasing new buildings, units or research `upgrades <axis_and_allies_upgrades>`. The money drain will be displayed on the resource bar as negative income. It might be cheaper to just disband a costly unit or sell an unused bunker. It is not really beneficial to keep a huge surplus in ammo and oil, however. 

If your money is in the red, your regiments outside of the :ref:`supply <axis_and_allies_supply>` zone, will be taking damage until they self disband, and your regiments inside will be supplied much slower than normal.
