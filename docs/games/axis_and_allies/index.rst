Axis & Allies (2004) is a real-time strategy game based on the `namesake board game <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_%26_Allies>`_ for Windows 98/2000/ME/XP. `Data execution prevention <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/memory/data-execution-prevention>`_ has to be turned off for AA.exe for the game to work on modern versions of Windows. If the game crashes randomly try turn off some visual details and set CPU core affinity in task manager. 

Similar to other RTS games from that age, it features campaign, random map, custom map and online multiplayer match. You need to build :ref:`bases <axis_and_allies_buildings>` and :ref:`regiments <axis_and_allies_regiments>`, farm :ref:`resources <axis_and_allies_economy>`, research :ref:`upgrades <axis_and_allies_upgrades>` and attack enemy bases.
