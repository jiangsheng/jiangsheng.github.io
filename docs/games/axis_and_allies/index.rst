Axis & Allies (2004) is a real-time strategy game based on the namesake board game for Windows 98/2000/ME/XP. Data execution prevention has to be turned off (DEP) for AA.exe for the game to work on modern versions of Windows. 

Similar to other RTS games from that age, it features campaign, random map, custom map and online multiplayer match. You need to build :ref:`bases <axis_and_allies_buildings>` and :ref:`regiments <axis_and_allies_regiments>`, farm `resources <axis_and_allies_economy>`, research `upgrades <axis_and_allies_upgrades>` and attack enemy bases.
