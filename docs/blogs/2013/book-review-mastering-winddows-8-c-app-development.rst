Disclaimer: I am a Microsoft MVP in Visual C++, so is Pavel Yosifovich,
the author of the book. Mastering Windows 8 C++ App Development by Pavel
Yosifovich is a new addition to the Windows Store development books. It
took me a while to read (304 pages) but is well worth the time from the
perspective of a C++ developer. The book obviously went through great
lengths to be comprehensive, not only introduced the typical Windows
Runtime (WinRT) APIs in a crisp manner but also added a refreshment of
C++ 11, the Model View ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, and the Windows Runtime
C++ Template Library (WRL). In addition, being a book for C++
developers, the author’s emphasis on performance can be found in several
tips and discussions, which is a nice focus for C++ developers. There
are also several weaknesses in the book. Introducing WRL before C++/CX
may be a poor choice as it is difficult to inspire the reader with
laborious code. Also the book could use a few more details on DirectX
and some WinRT APIs such as GeoPosition. Nevertheless, the book is an
excellent text for the subject and I recommend the book to C++
programmers who want to start developing Windows Store apps and can do
research outside of the book.
