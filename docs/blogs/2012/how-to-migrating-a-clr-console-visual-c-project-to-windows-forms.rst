Note: `Windows <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows>`__ Forms
programming in new development is `discouraged by
Microsoft <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/913417/will-windows-forms-be-deprecated-in-favor-of-wpf>`__ at
this point as Microsoft wants to make full use of hardware accelerated
drawing instead of using the CPU-intensive
`GDI <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Device_Interface>`__. But
maintaining old Windows Forms code in `Visual
C++ <http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/visualc/default.aspx>`__ 2012 is
still supported, GDI isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Visual C++ 2012
removed the Windows Forms project template and I see people scramble to
find ways to create a Windows Forms project.  There is a walkaround
that's been around for years, that is, to convert a `CLR console
application <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/z6ad605x(v=vs.110).aspx>`__
to a Windows one, then add forms related code to the project. The basic
steps are listed
at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/317433, conveniently named "How to
suppress the console window for a managed extensions to Visual C++
`Windows Forms
application <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Forms>`__". Yes, the
need to convert a C++ console application to windows forms is that old,
back all the way back in the `managed extensions for
C++ <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managed_Extensions_for_C%2B%2B>`__
 days. So what I need to do to add Windows Forms support to a C++/CLI
console application? Of course the System.Windows.Forms.dll reference is
missing in a new console application, so I need to reference it:

- In code:

#using <System.dll> #using <System.Drawing.dll> #using
<System.Windows.Forms.dll> using namespace System::Windows::Forms;

- Or In IDE:

  - Select the project in Solution Explorer
  - On the Project menu or the context menu of the project node, select
    Properties
  - In the Property Pages dialog box, expand the Common Properties node,
    select `Framework and
    References <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/47w1hdab(v=vs.110).aspx>`__,
    and then click Add New Reference.
  - Find and add System.Windows.Forms in the list of available
    references.

In reality the `Windows Forms
Designer <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/e06hs424(v=vs.110).aspx>`__
generates a lot of layout code that uses System.Drawing types like Point
and Size, so I need to repeat the steps for System.Drawing. Next the
console window needs to be suppressed. The C++/CLI console project
template in fact does not specify an entry point, so compiler guesses
because a main function exists, the project is a console application. A
Windows Forma application's entry point has the same signature with the
main function, therefore
the `/subsystem <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fcc1zstk.aspx>`__
setting of the project needs to be changed to Windows:

- Go back to the project's Property Pages dialog box.
- Click the Linker folder on the type.
- Click the System property page.
- Change the SubSystem property to Windows.

Ready? Not yet. The compiler is now trying to find a WinMain function,
and throws LNK2028 and  LNK2019 when it can't find the entry point,
which of course isn't there. I am not interested in writing one as I
prefer to keep the nice args `command line
parameter <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface>`__ of an
array<String^>^ type , so I need to tell the compiler my `entry
point <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f9t8842e(v=vs.110).aspx>`__
function is still main:

- Go back to the the Linker folder.
- Click the Advanced property page.
- Change the `Entry Point <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entry_point>`__
  property to main.

We are almost here. `Windows Forms needs an STA
thread <http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jfoscoding/archive/2005/04/07/406341.aspx>`__,
so I have to add  [STAThreadAttribute] to the main function:
[STAThreadAttribute] int main(array<System::String ^> ^args) { ..... //
wait did I add anything here? I guess not yet Here you go,  a Windows
Forms application that does nothing interesting.  Mmm, to make it a
little more visual, I create a new Windows Form class named Form1 and
run it in the main function: //before main function #include "Form1.h"
using namespace ProjectName; //in the main function
Application::EnableVisualStyles();
Application::SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false); // Create the
main window and run it Application::Run(gcnew Form1()); Yada! I have a
Windows Forms application running now.
