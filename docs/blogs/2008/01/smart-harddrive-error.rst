In case anyone is googling this message

   Hard Drive SELF MONITOR SYSTEM has reported that a parameter
   has exceed its normal operating range

   Dell recommends that you back up your data regularly

   Press F1 to continue, Press F2 to enter setup

After running event log viewer and look for warning messages. I have
several messages looked like this

In addition, 0 other I/O requests to this file have also taken an abnormally long time to be serviced since the last message regarding this problem was posted 0 seconds ago. This problem is likely due to faulty hardware. Please contact your hardware vendor for further assistance diagnosing the problem.

The reaction is obvious: contact Dell Customer
Support.

Thankfully, I have daily incremental backup and weekly
full system backup, but my daily has been
failing. So I will lose a week's data, not a big deal.
