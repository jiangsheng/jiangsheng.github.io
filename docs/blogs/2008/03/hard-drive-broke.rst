The first 3 Dell support technicians tried to persuade me to clean
the temp files, to remove unnecessary startup programs and to
reinstall Windows. It does not help if the computer complains an
error during self test. I keep saying a self test error can not be
solved by twisting the OS, but they won't listen. After educating the
representatives for a week I finally got one that has better
experience (and better English) to examine my computer. A full system
test shows bad sectors on the hard drive, and totally toasted the
hard drive. Luckily I just bought the computer for 6 months so I
asked for a replacement. Dell sent me one in 2 days and I sent back
the broken one.

Now my back up hard drive started to fail ... Time to call Seagate.
