   McDonald's and Yum! Brands, the owner of KFC and Pizza Hut were the
   targets of an undercover investigation made by New Express Daily
   reporters.

   The report pointed out several violations of labor laws:

   - Minimum wage. McDonald's, KFC and Pizza Hut were paying part-time
     employees as much as 40 percent less than the local minimum wage
     for part-time employees.
   - Contract. The stores refused to give the contract text to some
     employees.
   - Part time probation. Part time probation is still in their
     contracts text after being outlawed for 4 years.
   - Long hours. Have part time employee working full time hours (up to
     10 hours a day), thus deny them full time benefits.

   A spokesman of KFC argued that their student workers are exempt from
   the local minimum wage law because they are neither full-time nor
   part time workers. Legal experts say there is no other
   alternative-time worker type exists.

   Update:

   Another
   `report <http://finance.sina.com.cn/g/20070328/06363447115.shtml>`__ says
   the Pizza Hut contract states "this contract is not governed by labor
   law", while the labor law says it covers any paid labor between
   business and natural person.

   The report also says the majority of McDonald's and KFC employees can
   not get their contract back after they signed it. Legal experts say
   this is to destroy the evidence.  McDonald's contract also includes
   the part time employees discipline, which is changed unilaterally.

   Facts:

   McDonald's has 670 branches and over 50,000 employees in China.

   Yum! Brands has more than 1,500 branches and over 100,000 employees
   in China.
