Today's fake email of the day

Hi Dear,

How are you doing hope you are fine and OK?

I was just going through the Internet search when I found your email
address

.......

| So you care about an article titled "
| Trap CtrlAltDel; Hide Application in Task List on Win2000/XP" in 2020
  and downloaded its source code, but still don't know my name?

| Also when I read the message header (it is called view source in
  hotmail or view original in gmail)
| From: Lisa Williams lw716545@gmail.com
| Reply-To: lisawilam@yahoo.com
| Message-ID: 1900588789.741179.1601566380447@mail.yahoo.com
| References: 1900588789.741179.1601566380447.ref@mail.yahoo.com
| X-Mailer: WebService/1.1.16718 YMailNodin Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1;
  rv:81.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/81.0
| Content-Length: 572
| X-IncomingHeaderCount: 14
| To: Undisclosed recipients:;
| Return-Path: lw716545@gmail.com

So this is a bulk mail, I am BCCed. Kinda strange to do for a letter
that express love interest. But Kudos to keep your Firefox version up to
date! Although the scammer can lie here too if wanted to just like
everywhere else, there is nothing really beneficial to say you mailed it
from Microsoft Outlook Express.

Also in the mail header:

Received-SPF: SoftFail (protection.outlook.com: domain of transitioning
gmail.com discourages use of 74.6.132.41 as permitted sender)

I wonder why...
