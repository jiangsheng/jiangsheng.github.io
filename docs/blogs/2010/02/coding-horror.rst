In `this
post <http://topic.csdn.net/u/20100131/22/ee086edf-21e3-4fb3-9874-031bf1fcc64d.html>`__,
there are several things programmer complain their predecessor

- hundreds of forms named form1,form2, etc
- No `design
  document <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_document>`__
  and no
  `comment <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comment_%28computer_programming%29>`__,
  or writing comment in Japanese in critical modules
- Does not know how to use
  `loop <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow>`__ to reduce
  hundreds of lines to a few lines
- name variables like aa,bb,cc, etc
- Pretend to know how to code. E.g. claim the TreeView control in VB6
  cannot be manipulated in a loop, then blame
  `Microsoft <http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=47.6395972222,-122.12845&spn=1.0,1.0&q=47.6395972222,-122.12845%20(Microsoft)&t=h>`__
  for catching `syntax
  errors <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_error>`__ and declare them
  as Microsoft Bugs, This guy also somehow make a three-line loop into
  255 lines.
- Writing comments like “//I also don’t know what the following code
  does”
- Extensive gotos

And imagine you are asked to cleanup the code… So don’t do things that
your successors would complain.
