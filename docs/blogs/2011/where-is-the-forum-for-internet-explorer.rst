People get confused by various Microsoft IE forum sites so here is the
steps to find the forum closer to IE related questions Basically, the
mentality of different Microsoft forum brand is: MSDN: How can my
software do something on my customers' machines. Technet: How can I
manage things on machines in my network. Answers: How can I do something
on my own machine. So for the case involving IE:

#. using IE http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum
#. manage IE on someone else’s machine, or IE behaves abnormally only
   when the IE settings is managed by the `network
   administrator <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_administrator>`__
   `ttp://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/category/internetexplorer <http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/category/internetexplorer>`__
#. Writing IE-aware software or IE-aware web sites
   http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/category/iedevelopment/

What about other tasks?

#. I have problem with an IE add-on contact the support channel of the
   add-on. For example if there is a problem when viewing PDF in IE,
   most likely you need to visit the `Adobe
   Reader <http://www.adobe.com/acrobat>`__ forum at forums.Adobe.com. A
   question that occurs only after installing `Google
   ToolBar <http://toolbar.google.com/>`__ should be posted to Google's
   help groups.
#. I see an error message in IE when visiting a web site does the error
   message appear when you switch to another web browser?

   #. Yes Contact the author of the web site

      #. But I am the author of the web site! Then try ask in a forum
         that covers the server programming framework, for example,
         visit forums.asp.net if you have ASP.Net errors.

   #. No `Run IE in no-addon
      mode <http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2006/07/25/678113.aspx>`__\ (shortcut
      can be found in programs->accessories), is the problem still
      there?

      #. Yes Do you see this error when visiting other web sites?

         #. Yes visit http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum
         #. No Contact the author of the web site

            #. But I am the author of the web site! Then visit
               http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/iewebdevelopment/threads
               and remember to include your web site’s link when asking
            #. 

      #. No, where do I find the faulty add-on? Tools->Manage addons,
         and disable one-by-one, I guess. Those experts in
         http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum probably have more
         experience in known faulty add-ons.

#. IE tells me there is a script error on the web site Does this problem
   occur regardless which web sites IE is showing?

   #. Yes Visit http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum. Oh, and if
      you are going to do a repair install of IE before asking, remember
      to turn antivirus off.
   #. No, the script error only occur on certain web sites Are you the
      author of the web site involved?

   #. 

      #. No Contact the authors of the web sites.

         #. The author cannot be found or I can't wait the author to
            release an update Add the web site to the `compatibility
            view
            list <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd567845(v=VS.85).aspx>`__ to
            see if the site works in old browser emulation mode.

      #. Yes, I am the author If you can reproduce your problem in
         no-addon mode, visit
