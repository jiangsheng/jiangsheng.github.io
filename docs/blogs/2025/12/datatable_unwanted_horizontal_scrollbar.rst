I am using the `Javascript DataTable <https://datatables.net/>`_ component to provide a sortable HTML table experience in \ :ref:`Front Mission <front_mission_mechanics_pilots>`\  and :ref:`4th Super Robot Wars <srw4_units_data_snes>` gaming guides. However there was a long standing issue that the table shows horizontal scrollbar even when the content is not too wide.

I have tried a few solutions I found online, including setting `scrollX <https://datatables.net/reference/option/scrollX>`_ to false, adding :code:`table-layout:fixed; width: 98% !important` to the dataTables_no_scroll_x css class, and adding \ :code:`overflow-x:hidden !important; overflow-y:auto !important;`\ to the dataTables_scrollBody css class, to no avail. 

As my tables are high, the scroll bar is not visible unless the user scrolls to the very bottom of the page. I let the bug stood for a while.

Recently I finally find the time to debug the issue in F12 developer tools. It looks like the scroll bar is not from the HTML <table> element but from the <div> element that wraps the <table> element, a container generated by the DataTable component. Adding :code:`overflow-x:hidden !important;` to the div.dt-container class in the css fixed the issue. As dt-container seems to be only used for the DataTable wrapper, I think there won't be a conflict with other components or within DataTable itself. In theory I can also modify $.fn.dataTableExt.oStdClasses.sWrapper in javascript but that would be slower.
