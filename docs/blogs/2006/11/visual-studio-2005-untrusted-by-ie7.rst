   Today I upgraded one of my development machine to IE7. Everything
   looks fine, except I have to change the `FileDownload event
   handler <http://support.microsoft.com/kb/325204>`__ to make my code
   compile.

   However, suddenly I found Visual Studio 2005 is complaining:

   Conclusion:

   - Visual Studio is based on WebBrowser control (Is this news story?)
   - Upgrade to IE7 may break some applications (Again, is this a news
     story?)

   Everything else works fine so far...
