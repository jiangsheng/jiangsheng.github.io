   Trade war over genetically modified food From Wikipedia, the free
   encyclopedia.


   The `European Union <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union>`__
   and the `United
   States <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States>`__ have strong
   disagreements over the EU's regulation of `genetically modified
   food <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_food>`__. The
   US claims these regulations violate `free
   trade <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade>`__ agreements, the EU
   counter-position is that `free
   trade <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade>`__ is not truly free
   without informed consent.

   In `Europe <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe>`__, a series of
   unrelated `food crises <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_crises>`__
   during the `1990s <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990s>`__ have
   created `consumer <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer>`__
   apprehension about `food
   safety <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_safety>`__ in general,
   eroded public trust in government oversight of the `food
   industry <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Food_industry&action=edit>`__,
   and left some consumers unwilling to consider "science" to be a
   guarantee of quality.

   This has further fueled widespread
   (`[1] <http://terresacree.org/sondage.htm>`__ (*http://terresacree.org/sondage.htm*))
   public concern about `genetically modified
   organisms <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism>`__
   (GMO), in terms of potential environmental protection (in particular
   `biodiversity <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity>`__),
   `health <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health>`__ and
   `safety <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosafety>`__ of consumers.
   Critics of GM foods contend that there is strong evidence that the
   cultivation of a genetically modified plant may lead to environmental
   changes. However, whether a genetically modified plant can itself
   harm the environment is a matter of controversy among scientists.

   Although some claim genetically modified foods may even be safer than
   `conventional <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conventional_food&action=edit>`__
   products, many European
   `consumers <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumers>`__ are
   nevertheless demanding the right to make an `informed
   choice <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent>`__. Some polls
   indicate that Americans would also like labelling but it has not yet
   become a major issue. New EU regulations should require strict
   `labelling <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_labelling>`__ and
   `traceability <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceability>`__ of all
   `food <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food>`__ and `animal
   feed <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_feed>`__ containing more
   than 0.5 percent GM ingredients. Directives, such as directive
   2001/18/EC, were designed to require authorisation for the placing on
   the market of GMO, in accordance with the `precautionary
   principle <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_principle>`__.
   (see also `Tax, tariff and
   trade <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax,_tariff_and_trade>`__).

   Despite the fact that no scientific study has yet shown genetically
   modified food to be harmful to humans, a 2003 survey by the Pew
   Research Center found that a majority of people in all countries
   surveyed felt that GM foods were "bad". The lowest scores were in the
   US and Canada, where 55% and 63% (respectively) were against, while
   the highest were in Germany and France with 81% and 89% disapproving.
   The survey also showed a strong tendency for women to be more opposed
   to GM foods than men.
   `[2] <http://people-press.org/commentary/display.php3?AnalysisID=66>`__ (*http://people-press.org/commentary/display.php3?AnalysisID=66*)

   In 2002, Oregon Ballot measure 27 gave voters in that state one of
   the first opportunities in the United States to directly address the
   question. The measure, which would have required labeling of
   genetically engineered foods, failed to pass by a ratio of 7 to 3.

   Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf, member of the `German Green
   Party <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Green_Party>`__ and vice
   president of the Landwirtschaftsausschuss (committee of agriculture)
   of the `European
   Commission <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission>`__ said
   on the `1 July <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_1>`__
   `2003 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003>`__: "In America 55% of the
   consumers are against GM food and 90% in favor of a clear labelling.
   The Bush government is ignoring the demand of his own people."

   European ban on genetically modified crops
   In `1999 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999>`__, a 4 year ban was
   pronounced on new `genetically modified
   crops <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Genetically_modified_crop&action=edit>`__.
   At the end of 2002, `European
   Union <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union>`__ environment
   ministers agreed new controls on GMOs that could eventually lead the
   then 15-members bloc to reopen its markets to GM foods. European
   Union ministers agreed to new labelling controls for genetically
   modified goods which will have to carry a special harmless DNA
   sequence (a `DNA code
   bar <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DNA_code_bar&action=edit>`__)
   identifying the origin of the crops, making it easier for regulators
   to spot contaminated crops, feed, or food, and enabling products to
   be withdrawn from the `food
   chain <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_chain>`__ should problems
   arise. A series of additional sequences of DNA with encrypted
   information about the company or what was done to the product could
   also be added to provide more data. (see `Mandatory
   labelling <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_labelling>`__).

   Agricultural trade market between USA and Europe
   The European Union and United States are in strong disagreement over
   the EU's ban on most genetically modified foods.

   The value of agricultural trade between the US and the European is
   estimated at $57 billion at the beginning of the 21st Century, and
   some in the U.S., especially farmers and food manufacturers, are
   concerned that the new proposal by the European Union could be a
   barrier to much of that trade.

   In 1998, the United States exported $63 million worth of corn to the
   EU, but the exports decreased down to $12.5 million in 2002.

   The drop-off might also be due to falling commodities prices, less
   demand due to the recession, U.S. corn being priced out of foreign
   markets by a strong dollar, and `importing
   countries <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_government_positions_on_war_on_Iraq>`__
   reaction to the planned invasion in Iraq. But farm industry advocates
   blame the EU's ban.

   European proposal over genetically modified food
   The European Parliament's `Committee on the Environment, Public
   Health and Food
   Safety <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Committee_on_the_Environment,_Public_Health_and_Food_Safety&action=edit>`__\ `[3] <http://www.europarl.eu.int/comparl/envi/default_en.htm>`__ (*http://www.europarl.eu.int/comparl/envi/default_en.htm*)
   proposal, adopted in the summer of 2002 and expected to be
   implemented in 2003 has deep cultural roots, which are difficult to
   understand for the US agricultural community. It requires that all
   food/feed containing or derived from genetically modified organisms
   be labelled and any GM ingredients in food be traced. It would also
   require documentation tracing biotechnological products through each
   step of the `grain <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain>`__ handling
   and food production processes.

   The new European tax, tariff and trade proposal would particularly
   affect US `maize <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize>`__ gluten and
   `soybean <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soybean>`__ exports, as a high
   percentage of these crops are genetically modified in the USA (about
   25 percent of US maize and 65 percent of soybeans are genetically
   modified in 2002).

   The ultimate resolution of this case is widely thought to rest on
   labelling rather than `food
   aid <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_aid>`__. Many European
   consumers are asking for food regulation (demanding labels that
   identify which food has been genetically modified), while the
   American agricultural industry is arguing for `free
   trade <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade>`__ (and is strongly
   opposed to labelling, saying it gives the food a negative
   connotation).

   `Lori
   Wallach <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lori_Wallach&action=edit>`__,
   director of `Public Citizen's Global
   Watch <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Public_Citizen's_Global_Watch&action=edit>`__
   indicates that American agricultural industry is "using trade
   agreements to determine domestic health, safety and environmental
   rules" because they fear that "by starting to distinguish which food
   is genetically modified, then they will have to distinguish energy
   standards, toxic standards that are different than those the European
   promotes".

   The American Agricultural Department officials answer that since the
   United States do not require labelling, Europe should not require
   labelling either. They claim `mandatory
   labelling <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_labelling>`__ could
   imply there is something wrong with genetically modified food, which
   would be also a `trade
   barrier <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_barrier>`__. Current U.S.
   laws do not require GM crops to be labelled or traced because U.S.
   regulators do not believe that GM crops pose any unique risks over
   `conventional
   food <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conventional_food&action=edit>`__.
   Europe answers that the labelling and traceability requirements are
   not only limited to GM food, but will apply to any agricultural
   goods.

   The American agricultural industry also complain about the costs
   implied by the labelling.

   Official US complaint with the WTO
   The ban over agricultural biotechnology commodities is said by some
   Americans to breach `World Trade
   Organisation <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organisation>`__
   rules. Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative,
   indicated the European position toward GMO was thought of as
   "immoral" since it could lead to starvation in the `developing
   world <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country>`__, as seen
   in some famine-threatened African countries (eg, Zambia, Zimbabwe,
   and Mozambique) refusing to accept US aid because it contains GM
   food.

   Zoellick's critics argue that US concern over `Third
   World <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_World>`__ starvation is
   merely a cover for other issues. Some money for development aid is
   used by the American government via the `World Food
   Program <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Program>`__ (WFP) to
   help their farmers by buying up overproduction and giving it to the
   UN organisation. GM-scepticism interferes with this program. American
   farmers lost marketshare in certain countries after changing to
   genetically modified food because of sceptical consumers.

   Another European response to the claims of immorality is that the EU
   gives 7 times more in development aid than the US.

   In May 2003, after initial delay due to the `war against
   Iraq <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq>`__, the
   Bush administration officially accused the European Union of
   violating international trade agreements, in blocking imports of U.S.
   farm products through its long-standing ban on genetically modified
   food. Robert Zoellick announced the filing of a formal complaint with
   the WTO challenging the moratorium after months of negotiations
   trying to get it lifted voluntarily. The complaint was also filed by
   Argentina, Canada, Egypt, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Chile,
   Colombia, El Salvador, Honduras, Peru and Uruguay. The formal WTO
   case challenging the EU's regulatory system was in particular lobbied
   by U.S. biotechnology giants like
   `Monsanto <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto>`__ and
   `Aventis <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aventis>`__ and big
   agricultural groups such as the `National Corn Growers
   Association <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Corn_Growers_Association&action=edit>`__.

   EU officials questioned the action, saying it will further damage
   trade relations already strained by the U.S. decision to launch a war
   against Iraq despite opposition from members of the U.N. Security
   Council. The US move was also interpretated as a sanction against EU
   for requesting the end of illegal tax breaks for exporters or face up
   to $4 billion in trade sanctions in retaliation for Washington's
   failure to change the tax law, which the WTO ruled illegal four years
   ago.

   Ratification of the Biosafety Protocol by the EU parliament
   In June 2003, the `European
   Parliament <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament>`__
   ratified a three-year-old
   `U.N. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.N.>`__ `biosafety
   protocol <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosafety_protocol>`__
   regulating international
   `trade <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade>`__ in genetically
   modified food, expected to come into force in fall 2003 since the
   necessary number of ratification was reached in May 2003. The
   protocol lets countries ban imports of a genetically modified product
   if they feel there is not enough scientific evidence the product is
   safe and requires exporters to label shipments containing genetically
   altered commodities such as corn or cotton. It makes clear that
   products from new technologies must be based on the `precautionary
   principle <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_principle>`__
   and allow developing nations to balance public health against
   economic benefits.

   Jonas Sjoestedt, a Swedish Left member of the EU assembly, said that
   "this legislation should help the EU to counter recent accusations by
   the U.S administration that the EU is to blame for the African
   rejection of GM food aid last year".

   The United States did not sign the protocol, saying it was opposed to
   labeling and fought import bans.

   Lifting of the ban
   On `July 2 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_2>`__,
   `2003 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003>`__, the European parliament
   approved two laws that will allow the EU to lift its controversial
   ban on `GM
   food <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_food>`__. The
   first law will require labelling for GMO-containing food above 0.9%.
   It will be applied for human food and animal feed as well. However,
   animals fed with transgenic cereals will not be included in the
   labelling. The second law will make mandatory labeling of any food
   contaminated by non-authorized GMO (in the Union) over 0.5%. This
   amount will be set for 3 years. After 3 years, all non-authorized GMO
   contaminated food will be banned. Traceability of GMO products will
   be mandatory, from sowing to final product. At that time, it was
   expected the ban would be lifted in the fall of 2003.

   However, on the `8
   December <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_8>`__
   `2003 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003>`__, the European Commission
   rejected approval of a controversial genetically modified sweet corn.

   Six countries were in favour (33 votes - Spain, UK, Netherlands,
   Finland, Sweden, Ireland) three abstained (25 votes - Germany,
   Belgium, Italy), while six countries voted against (29 votes -
   Denmark, Greece, Luxembourg, Austria, Portugal, France).

   That new GM sweet corn, BT-11, produced by
   `Syngenta <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Syngenta&action=edit>`__
   was modified to produce its own
   `insecticide <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticide>`__ and is
   also resistant to a
   `herbicide <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbicide>`__. It was
   rejected for the following reasons :

   .. container::

      The new labelling and traceability regulations are still not in
      place
      The proposal did not include post-approval monitoring of health
      effects.
      Some safety questions have not been fully addressed.

   Geert Ritsema of `Friends of the Earth
   Europe <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Friends_of_the_Earth_Europe&action=edit>`__
   said: "There is clearly no scientific consensus over the safety of
   this modified sweet corn. The decision not to approve it is a victory
   for public safety and common sense. The European Commission now has
   the opportunity to re-think its position. The public doesn't want to
   eat GM foods and question marks remain over its safety. The
   Commission must put the well-being of European citizens and their
   environment before the business interests of the US Government and
   the biotech industry."

   The approval of that gmo corn would have been de facto considered as
   a lift of the moratorium on new GMO foods. Decision to lift the
   moratorium might occur in spring 2004.

   Effect of cultural differences between US and Europe
   The U.S. population has, historically, placed a considerable degree
   of trust in the regulatory oversight provided by the U.S. Department
   of Agriculture and its agencies. There is little tradition of people
   having a close relationship with their food, with the overwhelming
   majority of people having bought their food in supermarkets for
   years. But the 2003 survey by the Pew Research Centrer showed that
   even in the U.S. 55% see GM food as "bad" food.

   In Europe, and particularly in the U.K., there is less trust of
   regulatory oversight of the food chain. In many parts of Europe, a
   larger measure of food is produced by small, local growers using
   traditional (non-intensive & organic) methods (see `local
   food <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_food>`__).

   Talk:Trade war over genetically modified food

      From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

      Is Canada not involved in this mess?

      hum ? Which mess ? Rmhermen, since you are involved here...I wrote
      most of this article. Please, feel free to copy edit it strongly

      `User:anthere <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Anthere>`__
      I wonder if the article as written doesn't underplay the
      importance of agricultural protectionism. One of the advantages of
      forcing GM food labeling, I would think, is that it would give an
      advantage to small "organic" farmers. This seems quite convenient,
      given that the EU countries consider preserving the "quaintness"
      of their countrysides a cultural priority, while the death of the
      family farm seems to be more generally accepted in North America.
      Europe certainly wouldn't be alone in feigning concern over the
      supposed safety of foreign food in order to protect their own
      industries (look at what Japan is doing right now re: mad cow
      disease). --

      Sorry, but you hit with your "feigning" all the people that are
      worried. I am worried. So you directly hit me. You are right,
      agricultural protectionism is involved. But please take care when
      you just insult hundred of millions of people. (I could also use
      words on the same level of yours: In Europe we have still the
      culture to disagree on certain points and not to follow our
      leaders blindly... do you feel better now? ;-)
      `Fantasy <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Fantasy>`__ 05:39 1
      Jul 2003 (UTC) the usage of "feigning" is totally out of line :-)
      We don't feign. I would like to state that I wrote most of the
      initial article, and as such, it is only my perspective, and not
      enough to cover the topic by far. I tried to be far on both sides,
      but I am biased :-) In particular, it would be nice to have more
      on other countries positions on the matter. This is a planetary
      war, not to be reduced to US EU only. Yes, it would deserve much
      more on protectionism. Because this also very important. However,
      do not give too much importance in the topic to the advantage
      meant for the organic farmers. At least in my country (which is
      the first producer in the EU, so is of major importance in this
      trade war, since being the primary benefactor of protectionism),
      protectionism is meant to protect traditional agriculture, MUCH
      more than organic farming. We are first using traditional
      intensive technics, and the goal in requiring labels is to protect
      consumers, not organic farmers or organic consumers. Labels are
      envision for all food. There might be a different trend in other
      european countries, though I think generally not. ant
      What I meant was that the governments in European countries may be
      overplaying the risks of GM foods as a cover for protectionism. I
      have no doubt that many citizens are personally fearful.

      well, if you can find relevant references of people supporting
      this view, that is just fine. Anthere
      Also, I agree that this shouldn't be characterized as just a US
      vs. EU thing. In fact, the US and EU are traditional allies on
      issues of agricultural trade in that they're both strong
      protectionists. The alliance between the US and the pro-free-trade
      "Cairns Group" countries (Canada, Australia, and the developing
      world) is quite unusual. There are probably other countries
      (Japan?) that side with the EU for one reason or another.

      Also, I wonder about strains within EU, such as between food
      exporters like France and food importers (Italy? Spain?).

      Well, you can wonder of course :-) But this has nothing to do with
      this current discussion :-) It should belong to another article.
      Since there is a moratorium in Europe, exporting countries such as
      France do not export gmo toward food importers. Anthere
      p.s. If that "follow our leaders blindly" thing was a jab at the
      US, no dice, I'm Canadian (Happy `Canada
      Day <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Day>`__ to ya' :)

      Also, Europeans accusing North Americans of having a mob mentality
      is pretty ironic IMHO. When was the last time we had a war or
      genocide in North America? Europeans and your silly ethnic
      nationalism; when will you learn!?! ;) --

      Stewacide, you did not get the point. I just tried to explain you
      (probably with the wrong example, but it seems that you got
      insulted, so the effect was right) that YOU ARE HURTING PEOPLE. If
      you want to discuss something, would it not be better to
      concentrate on the facts istead insulting people with a different
      opinion than yours with "feigning".

      I think, it is better to restart the discussion:

      agricultural protectionism versus food safety

      - `stewacide <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Stewacide>`__
        thinks, that the EU is using worries about food safety to
        achieve agricultural protectionism.
      - `Fantasy <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Fantasy>`__ and
        `Ant <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Anthere>`__ agree that
        this is involved. But the main goal in requiring labels is to
        protect consumers, not organic farmers or organic consumers. Let
        the consumer decide, if they want to buy modified food.

      Perhaps "Genetic Engineering" should be added to the list of
      Demons and devils that someone is compiling, it certainly sounds
      very dangerous. `Ping <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ping>`__

      *Despite the fact that no scientific study has yet shown
      genetically modified food to be unacceptably harmful to people*
      ...

      Has any study found GM foods to be acceptably harmful to people?

      That's what I thought when I read it. I'm going to remove the
      "unacceptably" untill someone can show a study that indicated
      otherwise. --
      `stewacide <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Stewacide>`__ there
      were some "unacceptable" problems reported with severe cases of
      allergy. But the gmo have been removed. I am not aware of current
      relevant studies precisely on "acceptable" ones :-). However, I
      know of current environmental pbs which are considered acceptable.
      Fun :-)
      *Despite the fact that no scientific study has yet shown
      genetically modified food to be harmful or harmless to humans*

      How can any study or any number of studies ever prove something to
      be entirely "harmless"? --
      `stewacide <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Stewacide>`__

      IT CANT - it is impossible to prove a lone hypothesis, one can
      only accumulate evidence that is consistent (or not) with a system
      of hypotheses that constitute a philosophy. There will always be
      room for your hypothesis to turn out false, because other
      assumptions may be violated. Add to this that (the departing
      agriculture minister indicated) British field trials and other
      government funded research has intentionally neglected any
      'indirect' routes by which GMOs may cause harm to humans, such as
      damage to the ecosystem. So I am worried too (it's not like you
      can take GM out of the ecosystem if you got it wrong, and it's not
      as if Genetic Engineering is equivalent to the current system of
      genetic design).

      I was pointing out why the addition of the word "harmless" was
      meaningless and lacking in NPOV. It gives the reader the
      impression that insuffecient research has been carried out, when
      in fact no ammount of research could ever be suffeceient to make
      such a claim (I'm sure there's a fancy latin name for this type of
      rhetorical falacy). Would anyone object to me changing it back to
      "*Despite the fact that no scientific study has yet shown
      genetically modified food to be harmful to humans...*" ? --

      4 Jul 2003 (UTC) I don't think your proposed wording is true -
      IIRC some researchers added genes for manufacturing toxins to some
      previously edible food organism, then demonstrated that it did
      indeed become toxic... So we need to restrict the statement to
      stuff actually intended for human consumption (and to avoid giving
      a misleading impression, to indicate the extent to which people
      have looked - of course they wont have found a mechanism if they
      haven't looked at all - the amount of information in the statement
      is proportional to the amount of research done.).
      I wonder if `Trade in genetically modified
      food <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trade_in_genetically_modified_food&action=edit>`__
      wouldn't be a better title? Calling it a "trade war" may have NPOV
      problems. --

      But If you say "trade war" every one knows what we are talking
      about. Wikipedia uses many times the "used" words, not necessarely
      the "correct" word. Bush is going to court against EU, and if he
      does not win, I don't want to know what is next. (By the way: was
      the "cold war" a
      war?)\ `Fantasy <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Fantasy>`__
      21:10 2 Jul 2003 (UTC) it might be different another day. But
      currently, the trade is a war. An economical war. And that is what
      the article is talking about. Just talking about trade of a
      specific product would not perhaps justify an article. In all
      honestly, I think it would be prudery (politically correct) to
      rename an article without the "war" word, just to talk about
      "trade war" in it. And yes, it would be misleading on the topic
      indeed :-) ant (the cold war was a war imho)
      of course, you are all welcome to move that to the best host
      article  :-) But...if we start saying GMO plants have not been
      scientifically been proved to be dangerous, it is just fair that
      information is \*really\* added on the topic, yes ?
      `User:anthere <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Anthere>`__

      I think that most of this information on
      `Roundup <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundup>`__ should be moved
      to its page, not here.

      I see no pb with that. But, I mostly wrote this because it was
      added there were no credible scientific proofs GMO could be bad
      for the environment :-) I think I even forgot to look for RoundUp
      article. The only thing important imho is

      a high number of currently cultivated gmo are those resistant to
      glyphosate
      Round up sales have skyrocketted since GMO surfaces increased, and
      farmers cultivating gmos tend to use much more than before. Round
      up herbicide active ingredient is glyphosate
      Glyphosate (also cancerogenous- should I also add it ?) and other
      Round up ingredients have been proved (relevant scientific
      studies) dangerous at high quantities, safety issue for farmers,
      toxic for fauna, less degradable than claimed by Monsanto (even if
      it is \*far\* less toxic than plenty other herbicides)
      Consequently -> use of GMO -> use of round up -> more glyphosate
      -> pb for humans, fauna, water quality...

      Add cases of allergies, increase resistance, bt issues, studies
      showing diffusion of genes from one species to another (I have
      some virus diffusion at hand), I think that ultimately, the
      sentence "no credible studies have shown that some gmo have proven
      dangerous for the environment" should...just perhaps...be
      rephrased a bit ?

      When done, we could perhaps explain why Gmos are good for a
      change ?

      141, though I agree we should avoid to repeat unduly similar
      linkages in articles, I also think your way to hunt any double
      link is not a very good practice sometimes. When an article is -
      at two different places - referring to two different aspects of
      another article, it makes sens to orient the reader to this
      article again, not to let him search several paragraphs above the
      reference of this article he has maybe not focused on. This is
      very common practice in numerous
      articles.\ `User:anthere <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Anthere>`__

      | 

      Polls done in 2000, (Libération), 73% of French people worried by
      presence of GMO in food (77% for women)

      polls done end of 2002 show (libération)

      - French people totally opposed 48%, opposed 24 %

      polls in april 2002 (eurobarometre)

      - Only 31% of europeans would encourage GMO in food.
      - Spain, favorable 35%
      - Germany 52% strongly opposed
      - England, 25% favorable

      | 
      | Basically, 3 persons among 4 opposed and worried, that does not
        mean "some" but "widespread". Imho.

      It seems to me that this article has a lot of irrelevant
