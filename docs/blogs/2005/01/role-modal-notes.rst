   Good morning everyone. Today I would like to talk about my role
   modal, Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft Cooperation, and the
   wealthiest people in the world. I will describe two of his personal
   characteristics, his courage and his kindness, and how these
   characteristics inspired me. 

   First, he did some change in his life and business with great
   courage.

   In his personal life, he dropped out Harvard without graduating at an
   age of 20. A Harvard degree leads to a promising career.

   He carry some bold plans, such as introduced “Dot Net Framework”,
   while Microsoft products were still occupying more than half of the
   market at that time. He decided that most of new Microsoft products
   will move to .Net framework.

   He founded global research labs to develop “future technologies”,
   which little quick outcome

   Although I respect his courage, I didn’t quit my university as he
   did, because I think degree is important. However, I studied computer
   skills in my spare time, and work in IT area after graduated from
   Department of Mathematics.

    Second, he donated a lot of money to the public.

   He found the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, a foundation to help
   people education, global health and disasters. This foundation
   donates $1 billion each year. The foundation sponsors several health
   research projects, Scholars Program and library systems.

          I appreciate such contributions and I spend a lot of my spare
   time, use my computer skills to help others. I answered thousands of
   questions, and wrote tens of articles last year.

    As a summary, he is a man deserves my respect.
