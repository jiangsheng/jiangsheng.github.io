   Are Your Patients Exercising Too Much?

   According to the article “Are your patients exercising too much”,
   exercising too much may cause mental and physical problems. American
   College of Sports Medicine suggested an optimum limit of aerobic
   exercise of 60 minutes, 3 times a week. Exercising over this limit
   may cause lack of attention, risk more injuries, which can cause
   depression, and psychological problem, sometimes due to misbelieve
   “if a little exercise is good, then a lot is better”.
