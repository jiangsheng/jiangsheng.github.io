   Thanks to Austin Public Library, I have a chance to continue my
   navigating with Ender the Great Commander, the Xenocide, and the
   Speaker for the Dead. I'v noticed a significant difference between
   the style of Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead, and I like this
   change. It make ender a less hero, but a greater philosopher. His
   unconscious victory now considered crime, and he became his own
   accuser for 3,000 years. However, he still execl in this work. He
   removed the barrier between human and peggies, and made the treatment
   between the 3 species. 

   I did not notice the importance of the irrelavent quotation at the
   beginning of each chapter, but I found they are noteworthy for better
   understanding. They are kind of background information, and some
   sources appeard in the body part later.

   "We question all our beliefs, except for the ones we really believe,
   and those we never think to question. "
