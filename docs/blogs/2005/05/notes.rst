   | common law and jury system
   | legal system of country or the system of justice reflect the
     history and culture of the country

   | 
   | philosophical question about law, courts,trial,concept of
     innocent&guilt
   | people from diff cultures may answer it differently

   | 1 preferable for a dozen guilty people to go free rather than to
     punished one innocent people unjustly? orÂ  sometime nessary to
     punish innocent so no guilty people escape justine?
   | 2 guilty until proven innocent or is innocent until proven guilty?

   | Different between US system and other systems
   | 1 Common Law and how it differs from civil law
   | not unique, brought over from the first settlers from England.
   | Civil law (other eu countries) consult written code of laws to
     decide innocent/ guity and what sentence
   | Common Law(English speaking countries) developed case by case, not
     only by legal law, but also consider precedent et by other cases.
   | 2 jury system. Constitution ensure the right of trial by jury.
   | Not judge,but also jury.Listen to testimony and reach a verdict.
   | Civil law suit:Which side is right and how much to pay damages.
   | Criminal law suit:Guity or innocent.
   | How jury reach the decision? Judge deals with the law, jury deal
     with the fact(sth happened or not )
   | If beyond a resonable doubt ,must acquit.
   | required number of jurors don't agree, hang jury, law requires new
     trial with new new jury.
   | Not too efficient.e.g. hang jury, jury selection takes additional
     time. Attoney select reject jurors who interested and prejudiced,
     or with no reason. Unbiased group of citizens.Prefer Not by
     authority.
   | 3 plea bargaining.
   | Only about 20% legal cases accurally reached the court. Accused
     plea guity to a lesser crime. Civil cases set off despute with
     layers, or criminal cases plea bargaining (accuse with guity with a
     lesser crime). Large number of cases, otherwise the court is too
     crowded, no trail in court save time & money. Only if cooprate with
     the presecutor and bring others to justice for less servere
     punishment,
