   The survey is based on 3 male upper division students, 2 U.S.
   students and a International student from Vietnam. Questionnaires
   were asked several questions to express their view about university
   life. One student named himself Justin Loured; other two prefer to be
   not named.

   Majority of the interviewed students have a lot of homework-3 to 5
   hours per day. A student with double majors (no named #2) has 5-hours
   homework per day, Justin Loured has 3-4 hours per day, while he is
   taking 5 classes only. The major difference between how they imagined
   and how they fell about the university is the difficulty of the
   courses, and they think the professors are good and fair in grading
   students.

   The survey results also indicate that local students felt more
   comfortable in the freshman year. International students study hard
   to get ride of stress, while local students go to see some friend or
   pray. International students consider more about excellence about a
   school in admission, hile local students consider about the location.
   Senior students take fewer classes in a semester, except the one who
   is studying for double major.
