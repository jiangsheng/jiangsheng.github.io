   Chinese is famous for its food. In the history, Chinese have
   tradition to eat a wild range of foods and does not have a good
   eating habit, but it is changed in recent years. Chinese not only
   changed some food sources, but they also changed the ways they eat.

    

   First, some foods are not important in Chinese diet as before. For
   one, Rice used to take a great part of Chinese diet, but rice is less
   ate now before because people are getting rich and have more choice
   on food, such as meat or fast food. As a side effect, diet foods
   consumption is increasing. For another, people stopped eating some
   wild animals because they are frightened by the spread of SARS. A
   characteristic of Chinese diet culture is that people eat almost all
   animals, such as monkey, bear, crow, toad, snake, mouse, spider,
   roach and scolopendra, but after the burst of SARS, people don’t eat
   them anymore.

    

   Second, people changed their eating habits a lot. Not only modern
   lifestyle prevent people from waiting hours for a complex cooking,
   but also a lesson taught by the spread of SARS rejects some unhealthy
   traditional habits. In modern life, people prefer fast food because
   they have only little time for them. Long time cooking, as a
   contrast, is unlikely happen in modern lifestyle. One off dishware is
   more often used because of health consideration.

    

   Although China has a long history about food, the Chinese changed a
   lot in food area. This is caused by globalization and preventing some
   diseases.
