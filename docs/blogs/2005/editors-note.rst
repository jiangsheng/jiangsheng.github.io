   | Dear Editor,
   | I read with very mixed feelings your report entitled "Urban Park"
     on page 3 of your newspaper today.

   First, I am most delighted that the city government continues
   supporting Urban Park Project (UPJ). I am also pleased with that the
   government had assured that the urban park will continue to preserve
   nature instead of to change it to a tourist site.

   However, I am sorry to hear that the UPJ can not support Urban Park
   in all forms because it has limited resources. Since maintaining this
   project need more funds than expected, I suggest that limited,
   sustainable tourism such as ecotourism and working holidays should be
   arranged to help the UPJ experts continue to do their best.

   | Thank you.
   | Jason
