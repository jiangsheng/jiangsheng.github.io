   | Telephone Tips
   | 1. Speak slowly and clearly
   | Listening to someone speaking in a second language over the
     telephone can be very challenging because you cannot see the person
     you are trying to hear. However, it may be even more difficult for
     the person you are talking with to understand you. You may not
     realize that your pronunciation isn't clear because your teacher
     and fellow students know and understand you. Pay special attention
     to your weak areas (such as "r's" and "l's" or "b's" and "v's")
     when you are on the phone. If you are nervous about using the phone
     in English, you may notice yourself speaking very quickly. Practise
     or write down what you are going to say and take a few deep breaths
     before you make a phone call.
   | 2. Make sure you understand the other speaker
   | Don't pretend to understand everything you hear over the telephone.
     Even native speakers ask each other to repeat and confirm
     information from time to time. This is especially important if you
     are taking a message for someone else. Learn the appropriate
     expressions that English speakers use when they don't hear
     something properly. Don't be afraid to remind the person to slow
     down more than once. Keep your telephone in an area that is away
     from other noise distractions such as a radio or television.
   | 3. Practise with a friend
   | Ask another student to practise talking on the phone with you. You
     might choose one night a week and take turns phoning each other at
     a certain time. Try to talk for at least fifteen minutes. You can
     talk socially, or role play different scenarios in a business
     environment. If you don't have access to a telephone, you can
     practise by setting two chairs up back to back. The most important
     thing about practising telephone English is that you aren't able to
     see each other's mouths. It is amazing how much people lip-read
     without realizing.
   | 4. Use businesses and recordings
   | There are many ways to get free telephone English practice. After
     business hours, you can call and listen to recorded messages. Write
     down what you hear the first time, and then call back and check if
     your notes are accurate. Use the phone in your everyday life. Call
     for a pizza delivery instead of going out to eat. Call a salon to
     book a hair appointment. You can even phone the movie theatre to
     ask for the listings instead of using the newspaper. Some large
     cities have free recordings you can call for information such as
     your daily horoscope or the weather. (Make sure that you aren't
     going to get charged for these numbers first.) Some products have
     free phone numbers on the packaging that you can call for
     information. Think of a question you might want to ask and call the
     free number! For example, call the number on the back of the cereal
     box and ask for coupons. You will have to give your name and
     address. Make sure you have a pen handy so that you can repeat the
     information and check your comprehension.
   | 5. Learn telephone etiquette (manners)
   | The way that you speak to your best friend on the phone is very
     different to the way you should speak to someone in a business
     setting. Many ESL speakers make the mistake of being too direct on
     the telephone. It is possible that the person on the other line
     will think that you are being rude on purpose if you don't use
     formal language in certain situations. Sometimes just one word such
     as "could" or "may" is necessary in order to sound polite. You
     should use the same modals you would use in a formal "face-to-face"
     situation. Take the time to learn how to answer the phone and say
     goodbye in a polite manner, as well as all the various ways one can
     start and end a conversation casually.
   | Practise dates and numbers
   | It only takes a short time to memorize English Phonetic Spelling,
     but it is something that you will be able to use in any country.
     You should also practise saying dates and numbers aloud. You and a
     friend can write out a list of dates and numbers and take turns
     reading them over the phone to each other. Record what you hear.
     Swap papers the next day and check your answers.
