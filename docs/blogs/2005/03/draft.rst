          Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province in central China, is the
   one of the largest city in China. It is a major inland transition
   center because it is the joint of Han River and Yangtze River, and a
   rallying point of Major railway. Its Hanzheng Street market is one of
   the largest markets in China. Thus, although tourism can be improved,
   but this is not effective, because the scabrous environment problems
   and poor infrastructures.

    

   Tourism in Wuhan, as one of the old, large cities, has developed
   already. According to the official website of Wuhan government, Wuhan
   was named Excellent Tourism City in China by National Tourism
   Administration. The city is hard to become more famous, build more
   conservation zone, have more transportation, or reveal more scenes.
   Although the number of tourists increased a little after several
   efforts were made in recent decades, such as that many railways, gas
   stations, highways, electrical billboard was disseminated, many
   hotels were built. However, the improvement is mainly for business
   purpose and their contributions to tourism are not very notable.

    

   Moreover, environment problems and relatively poor also make the
   development more difficult. Shortage of electricity has been an
   increasing problem and might hurts tourism. Intensive tourism
   produces a large amount of garbage, which is hard to clear. Heavy
   traffic is threatening old roads and bridges and hoists the cost of
   closing and repairing them. Pollution is damaging the ecosystem also.
   All of above are growing obstacles of tourism development and is hard
   to clear.

   In short, develop tourism in Wuhan is less effective because
   environment problems and infrastructures. The city should focus on
   these problems instead of investing in tourism.
