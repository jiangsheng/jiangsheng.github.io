   The Schiavo case

    

   On Feb. 11, 2000, Pinellas Circuit Court Judge George Greer claimed
   that there was ''clear and convincing evidence'' that Terri Schiavo
   would want to disconnect her feeding tube. Theresa (or Terri) Marie
   Schindler Schiavo, a woman in persistent vegetative state (PVS) for
   15 years who suffered a severer brain damage on Feb. 25, 1990 and is
   suffering the third removal of live support, thus could pass away at
   any moment now because nutrition and hydration supplies was cut since
   March 18, 2005 3:00 p.m. EST. This removal is request by Michael
   Schiavo, the husband and legal guardian of the 41-years-old woman
   against the wish of her parents. The parents of Terri keep appealing
   to restore her feeding tube and, despite of the rejection of the
   court, should regain the guardianship and the right of choose the
   future of their daughter because of the revealing of new evidences
   about her medical status, her willing and, as a result, the legacy of
   the request.

    

   For one, her medical status is still in debate; hence the current
   condition should be clarified before any decision about life
   termination. While Washington Times reported ”Nineteen Florida judges
   and six court appointed physicians have concluded Schiavo is in a
   persistent vegetative state, allowing the removal to proceed Friday
   after seven years of court wrangling.”(Washington Times, March 23,
   2005).However, CNN reported that “in the affidavit filed on behalf of
   the state, Dr. William Cheshire, a board-certified neurologist at the
   Mayo Clinic, stated that his review of Schiavo raises serious doubt
   about the current diagnosis. He said she displayed context-specific
   reactions to stimuli, such as upbeat music, colorful objects or the
   arrival of people into the room.” (CNN, March 24, 2005). 

    

   For another, no documentation will of Terri existed to support her
   husband’s word, which indicates that she does not want to live
   artificially. “She didn't leave any written instructions.” He
   admitted (AOL Journals, March 15, 2005).In another show named “Larry
   King Live”, he gave another claim: “We didn't know what Terri wanted,
   but this is what we want.  ”(CNN, March 18, 2005). Although this
   statement is not made in front of a court, the contradiction put the
   "clear and convincing" evidence finding into doubt., which made by
   Judge Greer to withdraw the feeding tube from Terri.

    

   Furthermore, Although Michael Schiavo rejected offers to when Michael
   Schiavo, a husband who has been living with another girlfriend for 10
   years and has two children by her, might have disqualified himself
   for a legal guardian by failing to implement the guardianship plans
   and requesting the death of his wife. In fact, there have been 3
   guardians ad litem appointed for Terri in last 15 years, namely John
   H. Pecarek, Richard Pearse, Esq. and Dr. Jay Wolfson. As a result,
   decision made by such a doubtable guardian should have less
   importance than her parents wish to keep their daughter alive.

    

   After these analyses, the feeding tube should be reconnected before
   the contradictions, namely physical condition and will of Terri
   Schiavo, are solved. It would be too late if it is not reestablished
   immediately. Since her husband is not a qualified guardian, her
   parents should receive her guardianship and then decide her fate.
