Tuitions

Equality of opportunity

* public school: funded by gov poor area , less money, less likely children have higher edu.
* Private/religious school not funded by gov(usual by religious org). Questions about private school student parents have to pay private school tuition and public edu tax.
* Increase secular nature equality
* pressure on use tax to private school. 
* arguments

  * lower taxes?public school offer the best change of equally. Should not be less funded. Private school diversity is its own concern.
  * parent decide, unfair tax as well as tuition

no solution to satisfy every one
 
use of the tuitions funds:

* each child to receive scholarship with educational value, schools compete the scholarship
* each child to receive scholarship with educational value, school can add tuition
  
in trouble:

* film "Stand and Deliver" poor students
