   Generation Gap Prevention

   I am only 7 years elder than my niece, and I thought there were no
   generation gap between she and me. I'm not so sure about this after I
   moved to the city where she lived. Although I could have a
   conversation about internet, computer and study with her like a
   teacher, I could hardly use another topic since culture evolved,
   fashion refreshed, famous names faded out, common words altered,
   politicians went in and out of position, and economic is reformed.
   Therefore, embarrassing silence frequently occurred. This scenario
   may remain true when I have a child, but now there is something I
   will do to narrow this gap, such as self-restraint, polite words and
   respect child.
