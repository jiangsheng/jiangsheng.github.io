Financial Aid Office,

Brooklyn Law School , 467 Atlantic Ave. Suit 632

New York, 10902

To whom it may concern:

I would like to apply a university scholarship to study for a degree in law in your school, starting next September. I had got B.A. of business from State University of New York at 1963. I have been working in Legal Services of Newark, New Jersey for five yours. I worked in St. John's Church, Hoboken as a volunteer and in community legal assistance program for 2 years.

My current book is about paralegal work with emphasis on tenant's right and immigration law. The book has included many articles and reports, several of which were written from your faculties. Because your university is in the forefront of work in this area, I would like very much to attend your school as a part-time student.

I am looking forward for your reply.
