   Primates nurse their young with milk. The primate family, namely
   monkeys and apes, is one of the major groups of mammals. The word
   "Primate" comes from the Latin word "primus", which means "first".
   Most primates live in tropical places; however, men, classified by
   Scientists as primates, live in almost all regions and climates of
   the world.

    

   A few primates live on the ground, but most primates spend their time
   in trees because they have good eyes, grasping hands and feet, and
   their bodies are well suited to life in the trees. First, primates
   have large eyes to look straight forward; in addition, higher
   primates can focus both eyes on the same object and some primates
   also see colors. Second, besides many other mammals have claws,
   primates have flat nails on the end of their fingers and toes to help
   support enlarged pads, which is sensitive to touch and have nonskid
   ridges. Last, although primates among the most intelligent of mammals
   for most of them have large brains, but the part related to the sense
   of smell of their brain is relatively small, because they do not
   depend much on their smell.

    

   Primates have fewer young than most mammals because a mother bears
   only one or two young at a time, but the young primates stay with
   their mothers for a longer time, which allows them to learn more from
   their mothers and the group they live in.
