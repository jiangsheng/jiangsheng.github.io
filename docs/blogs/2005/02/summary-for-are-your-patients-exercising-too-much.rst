This article is for DeBenedette, V. (1990). Are your patients exercising too much? The Physician and sportsmedicine, 18-8

Are Your Patients Exercising Too Much?

According to the article “Are your patients exercising too much”,
exercising too much may cause mental and physical problems. American
College of Sports Medicine suggested an optimum limit of aerobic
exercise of 60 minutes, 3 times a week. Exercising over this limit
may cause lack of attention, risk more injuries, which can cause
depression, and psychological problem, sometimes due to misbelieve
“if a little exercise is good, then a lot is better”.
