Introduction

“Attitude decides everything”, former Chinese men' soccer team coach Bora Milutinović kept telling to his squad during the qualification for World Cup 2002 Finals. Although the first experience in WC Finals was not enterprising, the qualification itself was considered as a great achievement. Why they could not occur in WC Finals earlier when they used to have better players and a better team? I think the main reason of it is that they did not realize their ability well. Well self-judgments of personal capabilities to initiate and successfully perform specified tasks at designated levels, expend greater effort, and persevere in the face of adversity, holds significant power for predicting and explaining academic performance in various domains. 

Conclusion:

Overall, there are consistent evidence of a strong perceptions of capability will have positive effect on performance, such as good control of expectations, persistence, self-motivation and efficiency.
