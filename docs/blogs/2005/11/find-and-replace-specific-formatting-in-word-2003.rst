      In `Microsoft Word <http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word/>`__
      2003, you can replace text as in other programs. However, you can
      replace line breaks, graphics, and special formats as well. For
      example, to seperact and to add a serial number before every
      sentence, you can replace sentence-ending punctuations, such as
      periods and question marks, to the same punctuations plus a line
      break, click the numbering toolbar button, and make some minor
      manual changes for misreplacement.
