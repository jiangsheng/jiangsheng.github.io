About the ACE Program

  The Award for Customer Excellence (ACE) program was created to reward and recognize
  customers who have demonstrated enthusiasm for Microsoft® products.


About the `MVP Program <http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/>`__

  Microsoft’s Most
  Valuable Professionals (MVPs) are recognized, credible, and
  accessible individuals with expertise in one or more Microsoft®
  products who actively participate in online and offline communities
  to share their knowledge and expertise with other Microsoft
  customers. Customers want an enriched pool of knowledge and real-life
  experience to tap for advice and feedback. MVPs are helping to
  satisfy this need by independently enabling customers in both online
  and offline technical communities. Customer feedback is vital to
  product development and R&D. The MVPs represent an important part of
  this feedback loop by providing another link for Microsoft to listen
  to the customer. The Most Valuable Professional Program is the way
  that Microsoft formally acknowledges the accomplishments of these
  individuals for their contributions to community. It is focused on
  fostering a vibrant global community where Microsoft and customers
  learn about each other through valued ongoing relationships. The key
  strategies the program employs are:

  - Recognize and engage with MVPs worldwide—Identify, enable, and
    empower community influencers through a consistent quality customer
    relationship with Microsoft that spans product groups, services,
    and field organizations.
  - Improve customer connection and satisfaction—Recognize more
    customers for their efforts and improve the quality of the
    experience on their turf and in their language.
  - Drive program excellence—Professionalize services, customer
    offerings, and worldwide roles and responsibilities to become more
    predictable and accountable to both internal and external Microsoft
    community customers.

  The MVP Program, in existence for over eleven years, is represented
  by over 2,600 MVPs in 81 countries.
