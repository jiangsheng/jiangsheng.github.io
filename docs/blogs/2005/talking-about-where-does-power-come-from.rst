      | The teacher said this confidently: Believe me, ten years later,
        you will still find those words insightful.

      I do believe so.

      People who are able to plan, and to implement the plans which
      facilitate innovation and change are invaluable.

   According to Clementino Mendonca's speech `"The new MSF - competing
   with development process
   " <http://www.adnug.org/ScheduleView.aspx?Id=75>`__, only 16% chaos
   (unplanned or almost unplanned) software projects were successful.
   Although I don't remember the success rate of methodized software
   projects, I am sure it is much higher than the chaos model.

   In China, as far as I know, most "workshop" style software companies
   use chaos models. It may be improved by using the new `Visual Studio
   2005 Team
   System <http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/teamsystem/>`__, but I
   am not sure about it, since other software management products, such
   as `Visual Source Safe, <http://msdn.microsoft.com/ssafe/>`__ are not
   widely used in these companies.
