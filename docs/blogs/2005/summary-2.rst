Given the graphs from “Population, Poverty and the Local Environment”, I conclude that the decreasing percentage of American
women’s share of paid employment is a contribution of increasing unpaid working in home, when the number of children increases. For
one, in the second graph, the unpaid house work-load increases gradually until the number of children exceed 7, which showed
expressed a sharp increase for 7 or more children. Generally speaking, an American woman who has more children would have more
house work. For another, according to the third graph, the percentage of American women’s share of paid employment steadily decreases when
the number of children increases. That is to say, the percentage of American women’s share of paid employment steadily decreases when
unpaid house working gradually increases.
