   Given the graphs from “Population, Poverty and the Local
   Environment”, I conclude that the decreasing percentage of American
   women’s share of paid employment is a contribution of increasing
   unpaid working in home, when the number of children increases. For
   one, in the second graph, the unpaid house work-load increases
   gradually until the number of children exceed 7, which showed
   expressed a sharp increase for 7 or more children. Generally
   speaking, an American woman who has more children would have more
   house work. For another, according to the third graph, the percentage
   of American women’s share of paid employment steadily decreases when
   the number of children increases. That is to say, the percentage of
   American women’s share of paid employment steadily decreases when
   unpaid house working gradually increases.
