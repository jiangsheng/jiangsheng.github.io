   Should GM(Genetic Modified) food production be controled by
   Government?

   Q(Drug) Why fostering drug plants is baned and fertilizing GM food is
   not?

   A:Drugs can benefit only some patients and will not benefit others's
   health. Some more effective replacements can also be composed in
   chemical labs.

   GM food can prevent starvation and its side effect is not known
   clearly. No more effective replacement found.

   Q(Clone) Why another genetic technology, Cloning, is baned and
   producing GM food is not?

   A: Cloning human is baned mainly for moral concern, and this concern
   does not occur for GM food.

   | Q: The government should deal with public affairs, and GM food
     production is one.
   | A: The government should deal some but not all public affairs, and
     restricting GM food production may delay or stop investigation for
     its side effect and genetic technology advance.

   | 
   | Q: The government should label GM food on sale.
   | A: It is not our topic. Our topic is wether the government should
     control GM crop production or not.The Comsumer can refuse the
     unlabelled products.Almost all GM products are labelled.

   | Q: GM food hurt the env
   | A: I am not sure about this. In fact, it is reported in China that
     GM corton reduced the use of insectcide and prevented the farmers
     from diseases caused by insectcide. It have a great advantage of
     prevention of starvation. And, can u tell me something "harmless"?

   ??Anyway, global warming appears to be a bigger threaten to global
   ecosystem, since its effects are already discovered.

   | Q: It is good, but it is developing and the gov should supervise
     the production for safety
   | A: That cost huge budget and make the gov large.

   ?? Why not use the fund to support GM research to ensure its
   security?

   | 
   | Why the gov should interven the application of a health developing
     technology?
   | Is the production of traditional crops harmless to people?
   | Don't you think the consumer should have the right to choose their
     diet, smoke or drink?The production of tobacco is not controled by
     gov.
