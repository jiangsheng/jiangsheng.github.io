   Find and evaluate sources on WWW

   There are several benefits to find information online(WWW), including
   saving time, reduce cost and more information source. Usually a web
   directory is not sufficient to find information a particular subject.

    

   As an entrance of search information, looking for some search engines
   is the first step of looking for information online. Bookmark such
   kind of frequently used web sites when you know them is a good habit.

    

   Next, you can begin your query at a search engine. Because the number
   of a query results may be overwhelming, refine a query to get a
   smaller number of result and more relationship is an important part
   of searching. You can find search instructions on the search engine
   web site.

    

   Third, usually you need to find some jargons to narrow the search. If
   you do not know any jargons, read some query results to summarize
   some jargons. Good jargons include a name of an expert in the area a
   common quotation and phrases.

    

   Fourth, look through all results and select some as information
   source and for looking for jargons. It is sometimes a most stress
   thing because it concerns about too many works.

    

   Finally, try to understand the query results and try to remember some
   jargons for later use.
