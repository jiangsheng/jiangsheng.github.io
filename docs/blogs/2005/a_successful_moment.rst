A Successful Moment
=============================
I am so proud that I was awarded Microsoft MVP (Most Valuable Professional) last year. I was so excited I was sleepless for days. I got an invitation of Global MVP Summit, where I recognized several MVPs and experts in Microsoft and have myself recognized by them. It was the highest horner I had ever been awarded. 

I was so inspired that I contributed more in the last year. I am re-awarded this year.
