         Weeks ago I got an email promising free `Visual Studio
         2005 <http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio>`__ if I qualify
         for the `Microsoft <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=4338.HK>`__
         Award for Customer Excellence from
         `www.microsoft-ace.com <http://www.microsoft-ace.com>`__,
         which, according to some Microsoft employees, is a genuine
         Microsoft program website, but is also registered by a third
         pary, and has a problem with the `SSL
         certificate <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security>`__.
         Today, I got a `UPS <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=UPS>`__
         package with 3
         `V <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Application_Lifecycle_Management>`__\ isual
         Studio Team System
         with `MSDN <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Developer_Network>`__
         Premium redemption cards and a Microsoft-watermarked paper
         stating "thank you for your passionate support for VSTS"... but
         from `www.mvpinvite.com <http://www.mvpinvite.com>`__, another
         website registered by 3rd party and seems has something to do
         with my MVPship? So confusing...
