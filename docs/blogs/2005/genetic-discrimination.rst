   Discrimination of gender, race in labor market has been a chronic
   problem in industrialized periods in United States. The advance of
   genetic technology produces a new kind of discrimination, genetic
   discrimination. In the article “Gene mapping may foster
   discrimination”, Paul Racer pointed out that a survey revealed “7
   companies are using genetic testing for job applications or
   employees”, according to the journal *Science*. However, I think it
   may cause public fear for genetic tests and researches and can be
   exploited to discriminate candidates.

   For one, since the public already have a skeptical attitude toward
   genetic engineering, the risk of future exploitation of personal
   genome, may cause some people to refuse taking genetic tests, and
   may drop off from genetic research programs, and then delay the
   progress of science. For another, although it is a great step to
   discover the relationship between gene and disease, the relationship
   itself is still a “possibility” of certain illness, and everybody
   would has some genes vulnerable to this or that diseases, and the
   decision of denying a qualified candidate by a kind of disease can be
   exploited to discriminate candidates.  

   After these analyses, I will be glad to see a genetic factor appear
   in next “Civil Rights Act” to prevent the abuse of genetic test in
   employment process, but State Laws acted faster than Federal Laws. As
   of 2001, according to David C. Bowen, Ph.D. and Nancy Segal, JD, 28
   states have passed laws on genetic discrimination in employment and
   34 have prohibited insurance discrimination” (Bowen, D. C. and Segal
   ,N. , 2001). These step may help people to get rid of the nightmare
   of genetic discrimination and change the attitude toward genetic test
   and researes. Still, we should always keep the genetic test results
   from employers and insurance companies, who may exploit the result to
   discriminate people.
