   | Primates 
   |  
   | Primates nurse their young with milk. The primate family, namely
     monkeys and apes, is one of the major groups of mammals. The word
     "Primate" comes from the Latin word "primus", which means "first".
     Most primates live in tropical places; however, men, classified by
     Scientists as primates, live in almost all regions and climates of
     the world.

    

   A few primates live on the ground, but most primates spend their time
   in trees because they have good eyes, grasping hands and feet, and
   their bodies are well suited to life in the trees. First, primates
   have large eyes to look straight forward; in addition, higher
   primates can focus both eyes on the same object and some primates
   also see colors. Second, besides many other mammals have claws,
   primates have flat nails on the end of their fingers and toes to help
   support enlarged pads, which is sensitive to touch and have nonskid
   ridges. Last, according to Gordon M. Shepherd (2004), “Comparisons of
   the decreasing size of the olfactory system relative to expansion of
   the visual, auditory, and somatosensory systems usually focus on the
   olfactory bulb and lateral olfactory tract, which are relatively
   small. “ That is to say, although primates among the most intelligent
   of mammals for most of them have large brains, but the part related
   to the sense of smell of their brain is relatively small, because
   they do not depend much on their smell(Humans Smell with Bigger and
   Better Brains) .

    

   Primates have fewer young than most mammals because a mother bears
   only one or two young at a time, but the young primates stay with
   their mothers for a longer time, which allows them to learn more from
   their mothers and the group they live in.
