   Sustainable Tourism in Mozambique, Part III

   Working Tourism

   Not only does Mozambique have many natural and culture tourism
   resources, but she also has great potential of working tourism
   opportunities. Working tourism in Mozambique is still in the
   beginning for historical and economical reasons. World Bank reported
   that “The resource base is seriously threatened by population growth,
   extreme poverty, poor management and utilization and lack of
   financial resources.” (Mozambique - Transfrontier Conservation Areas
   and Tourism Development Project, 2004). These potential working
   tourism positions distribute in many areas, such as education,
   infrastructure development and natural and culture conservation
   development.

    

   First, education positions are needed since local communities have
   little recognitions of tourism benefits and opportunities. Mr. Albino
   Celestino Mahumane, the Ministry of Tourism of Republic of
   Mozambique, reported that Mozambique had a very low level of
   schooling and “link between these resources and communities is
   crucial for development in the medium and long term.” (Mahumane, A.
   C., 2001). Possible positions could be English and Health, because
   there are many useful academic resources in these fields.

    

   Second, positions in infrastructure development, such as roads,
   airports, telecommunications, water and electricity, health services,
   should open to attract tourists. To develop tourism in inland area,
   more transportations and accommodations need to be built while most
   of these are near the coast currently. (Mahumane, A. C., 2001).
   Health service is another problem that needs assisting. Again,
   existing technologies and human resources from foreign tourists can
   be used to help efforts in these improvements.

    

   Last, increasing working positions for tourists in these areas not
   only help ecotourism projects with financial benefits but also with
   their skills and experiences. For one, “tourism in Mozambique is
   based on its natural resources” (Mahumane, A. C., 2001). For another,
   “Development of ecotourism projects does require cash and a good
   investment climate and some participants in the seminar felt that
   there were often considerable difficulties in securing finances for
   ecotourism projects.”(Seminar on Planning, 2001).

    

   After these analyses, where nature-based and culture-based tourisms
   are unlikely to have sufficient funds for themselves, working tourism
   can be a supplement of them. It not only provides assistance for
   them, but also creates its own attraction in education and
   infrastructure developing.
