   Spread of Blog

   Blog, or weblog, refers to certain kind of online journal that, it is
   time-stamped articles posted on websites, usually in reverse
   chronological order. In addition, it usually enables visitors to
   leave comments on the same web page of article, trace related blogs
   between different websites, and get notification if the blog is
   updated. It can also refer to the action of writing blogs.

   In a famous blog by R Blood, she observed that `Jorn
   Barger <http://www.robotwisdom.com/>`__ named his website, which with
   daily articles consisted of interesting links to websites and
   comments of these websites; as Weblog, and it is Peter Merholz who
   once broke Weblog into the phrase “we blog”.( Blood, R., September 7,
   2000), which was shortened to “blog” during spreading. The number of
   bloggers boosted after web based blog tools, such as one provided by
   Blogger.com since 1999, enabled writing blog or comments online, and
   publishing it with a few mouse clicks. But blog had not much
   attention at that time.

   The influence of blogs was boosted by political events. After the
   beginning of War on Terrorism, while interactive blogs focused on the
   war, namely warblogs, spread and gain readership because their
   immediacy and interactivity, and anonymity of comments, while the
   reaction of mainstream media were slowed by censorship. By the spring
   of 2003, Forbes Magazine used "war blogger" in this larger sense when
   listing the "best warblogs." In the U.S. presidential election of
   2004, Blogs by celebrity, such as journalists, politicians and
   president candidates, gained public attention. Recently, Microsoft
   said that the free blogging service, called MSN Spaces, had attracted
   4.5 million users during its preliminary test phase, which began last
   December and end a few days ago. The use of the word “blog” was so
   common that, “blog” was included in the Oxford English Dictionary
   soon (Quarterly updates to OED Online, March 13, 2003).

   Many mainstream medias noticed this tendency.

    

   Google bought blogger.com

   I started my first blog at September, 2003. I had been looking for a
   web application for simplify updating my personal homepage for a long
   time. The recent update page in my website consisted of paragraphs in
   reverse chronological order, with a timestamp to mark the date of
   update, so that the visitors will notice the new updates easily.
   Despite of its usability, to perform an update of my homepage, I had
   to find the proper insert-point in the page, add new paragraphs, and
   then use some FTP (file transfer protocol) software applications to
   upload the whole modified page to the web server. Soon I found guest
   books, where visitors can leave messages and internet forums, where
   registered users can start a discussion or join a discussion, are
   very useful but both of them are not eligible for a recent update
   part of my website because they are open for visitors,.

    

   they are hard to attract a wild range of visitors. The visitors can
   not discuss with the author about an online article without using
   other applications, such as email, and this limited the influence of
   websites. Soon online guest books appeared, enabled visitors to post
   comments of all articles in a single page. Soon internet forums were
   designed for discussion, enabled users to post comments of an
   individual article and then visitors can read the article and its
   comments in the same page. However, unlike internet forums and online
   guest books, blog articles have static address for individual
   entries, which enables search engines to list them in search results,
   and the large amount of trans-website links were considered as
   citation by the page rank systems, which used by search engines to
   sort results, made them appears in the front of the search result
   lists, thus increased the influence of blogs. Many blog tools also
   automatically add *TrackBacks*, *or* links between an article and the
   articles its references to simplify the difficulty when the visitors
   tracking between related articles. These features of blogs made
   trans-website discussion much easier, and these conveniences speed up
   the spreading of blog.

   In addition, several tools and services are developed for the
   proliferated demand and boosted new demands. Trackbacks make the
   related blogs linked together, and comments made it possible for
   authors to discuss their articles on the same page of the article.
   Blog hosting sites launched one another, and a lot of personal
   homepage providers became blog providers. News aggregators appeared
   to simplify posting and reading blogs. The page rank system used by
   search engines, promoted the most cited blogs by revealing their
   trackbacks International blog service providers made it possible to
   write blogs on localized websites. Such conveniences made blogging
   easier and more and more people became bloggers.

   Since the number of blogger increased so fast; it has formed many
   communities.

    

   Influence

   As a result of explosion of number of bloggers, several communities
   were created on certain topics and direct the discussion in existing
   communities such as warblogs, Blawgs, tech blogs and team blogs,
   sometimes called blogosphere. Opinions, ideas and discussions around
   a particular subject or controversy can easily spread in blogospheres
   through trackbacks and dominate the topic of a blogosphere in a
   period of time. In order to keep the high discussion quality of the
   blogospheres, some bloggers dispatch their posts into different
   blogospheres. For example, I have 5 blogs, one to trace the new
   technologies, one to discuss common technologies, 2 for archive, and
   1 for other posts.

   Some blogospheres have great influence. They have quicker responses
   to breaking news than major media (Conference Examines Blogs' Impact
   on News. Nov 14, 2004), and some news stories were knock down by
   bloggers (Macht J., Sept 27, 2004). They were also responsible for
   pushing the story of Trent Lott, then the Republican leader of the
   Senate into the news, after the mainstream media missed it, and
   caused his resign. MSDN blog, a group of blogs of Microsoft employees
   and product teams, became the information and feedback center of
   Microsoft related technologies.

   Businessman will never ignore such a large group. For one, Google's
   AdSense, which deliver content-relative ads to pages, became
   ubiquitous on blogs, and some bloggers can earn a lot of money by
   talking about certain products.(Gard,L. Dec 13, 2004). For another,
   many people tried a lot to post unwanted blog spam to promote the
   spammer's website, and made major search engines changed their page
   ranking system.

    

   Conclusion

   .    Despite of some tiny problems, more and more people will start
   blogging, entering blogosphere, and try to promote themselves. Blog
   will become as popular as email, or even more. Popular.
