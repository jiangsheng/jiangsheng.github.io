   influential Chinese artist and art educator who, in the first half of
   the 20th century, argued for the reformation of Chinese art through
   the incorporation of lessons from the West.

   Xu was first taught art in his childhood by his father, Xu Dazhang, a
   locally known portrait painter. In the period from 1919 to 1927, he
   studied in France and graduated from Paris Higher Art School He
   returned to China in 1927 and successively worked as a teacher in
   Shanghai South China College of Fine Arts He went to Beijing in 1946
   and worked as the President of Public Beijing Arts and History School
   and the Chairman of Beijing Art Workers Association. In 1949, he was
   elected as the Chairman of National Painters Association by the
   representative conference of all-China literary and art workers.

   | **Grazing Horse**, dated 1932
   | Xu Beihong (Chinese, 1895–1953); Qi Baishi (Chinese, 1864–1957)
   | Hanging scroll; ink on paper; 20 1/2 x 14 3/4 in. (52.1 x 37.5 cm)
   | Inscribed by the artist and by Qi Baishi
   | Gift of Robert Hatfield Ellsworth, in memory of La Ferne Hatfield
     Ellsworth, 1986 (1986.267.192)

   This painting exemplifies Xu Beihong's fusion of East and West. While
   employing the conventional Chinese medium of brush and ink, Xu's
   drawing technique is purely Western. Rather than defining the horse
   with calligraphically energized outlines, Xu sketches the horse
   impressionistically with light and dark washes and uninked areas of
   white paper integrated to suggest the modeling effects of light and
   shadow. Reflecting studies from life, the horse's complex
   pose—foreshortened body, twisting neck, and naturalistically placed
   legs—is deftly rendered in a few well-practiced brushstrokes, while
   the layered tones of the animal's tail give the impression of
   movement.

   Recalling a long tradition of the horse as an emblem of state, Xu
   Beihong's spirited animals appeal to national pride. He painted so
   many of them that they have become synonymous with his name. This
   early example, still fresh in his mind and in execution, was done for
   Qi Baishi's son on the occasion of a visit by Xu to Qi's house. Qi
   explains in his inscription that Xu failed to bring his seals, which
   is why the painting lacks an impression.
