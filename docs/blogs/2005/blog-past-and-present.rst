   II. Censorship E. Conclusion At December 5, 2002, on Sen. Strom
   Thurmond’s 100th birthday celebration, Sen. Trent Lott (R-MS) stunned
   his audience with his words “I want to say this about my state. When
   Strom Thurmond ran for president, we voted for him. We’re proud of
   it. And if the rest of the country had followed our lead, we wouldn’t
   have had all these problems over the all these years either.”, and
   probably stunned the mainstream media, made them unable to report
   this comment widely. But two bloggers, ”Atrios” and Joshua Marshall
   noticed it and wrote it down on their blog. Soon blogs about this
   comment were so widely spread that on December 10, the mainstream
   media restored their attention, and on December 20, Lott resigned as
   Majority Leader (Chris Wright, 2003). What is blog? Why is it so
   influential? Blog, or weblog, refers to certain kind of online
   journal, which is time-stamped articles posted on websites, and
   usually in reverse chronological order. In addition, it usually
   enables all visitors to leave comments on the same web page of
   article, trace related blogs between different websites, and to
   receive notification when the blog is updated. It can also refer to
   the action of writing blogs. To write a blog and publish it online
   now is no more difficult than to write and send an email online, but
   emails are private, while blogs are public. Many people believe a
   famous blog by Rebecca Blood recorded the history of blog. She
   observed in the blog that it is Jorn Barger who named his website,
   which consist of daily articles with interesting links to websites
   and comments of these websites, as Weblog. In addition, she believed
   that it is Peter Merholz who split “Weblog” into “we blog”, and this
   phrase was eventually shortened to “blog” (Blood, R., September 7,
   2000). The increasing of bloggers was accelerated by several free
   blog service providers launched with web based blog tools at 1999,
   such as blogger.com, which enabled writing blog or comments online,
   and publishing it with a few mouse clicks. However, blog still had
   not much attention at that time. Nearly 2 years later, blogs were
   popularized by political events after the beginning of War on
   Terrorism, while warblogs, interactive blogs focused on the war,
   spread and gain readership. The main attractions of them are their
   immediacy, interactivity, anonymity of comments, and the slowed
   reaction of mainstream media due to censorship. By the spring of
   2003, Forbes Magazine used "war blogger" in this larger sense when
   listing the "best warblogs." Later, in the U.S. presidential election
   of 2004, blogs created by politicians like president candidate John
   Kerry gained public attention. At , the software giant Microsoft said
   that its free blog service, called MSN Spaces, had attracted 4.5
   million users during its preliminary test phase between December 2004
   and April 2005 (Microsoft launches MSN blogging, messenger services,
   Apr 7, 2005). The word “blog” is phenomenally common that it was
   included in the Oxford English Dictionary only a few years after its
   invention (Quarterly updates to OED Online, March 13, 2003). Not only
   individuals, but also many business companies has noticed this tide
   of technology and stepped in, hosted many blogs on their public or
   private website. For one, several media, such as The Wall Street
   Journal, Washing Post, Fox News, BBC and CNN, began to publish
   articles, especially editorials in the form of blogs. For another,
   several giant companies, such Microsoft, have developed several blog
   systems for their product teams, individual staffs and customers for
   intensive interactivity. Looking for a simplification of updating my
   personal homepage for a long time, I joined this tide at September,
   2003, and found blog is the exact application I want. The recent
   update page in my website used to consist of paragraphs in reverse
   chronological order, with a timestamp to mark the date of update, so
   that the visitors will notice the new updates easily. Despite its
   usability, to perform an update of my homepage, I had to run an HTML
   editing application, open the update page, find the proper
   insert-point in the page, add new paragraphs, and then use some FTP
   (file transfer protocol) software applications to upload the whole
   modified page to the web server. Although online guest books and
   internet forums can generate this kind of web page automatically,
   both of them are not ideal for a recent update part of my website
   because they can be modified by visitors. When I found that I can
   perform an update by filling forms online, I began writing blogs
   almost immediately. Soon I found my blogs were cited in various other
   blogs and got comments from their readers. Their blog tools added
   links, namely trackbacks, to my blog automatically, and many visitors
   followed the links to read my blog. More visitors of my blogs come
   from search engines, while my posts on internet forums or guest books
   did not get so much attention because they do not have separate web
   address for each article. Some visitors came from certain kind of
   automatically generated lists of recently updated blogs, or
   blogpolls. Almost immediately after I started blogging, I was invited
   to write blog for a semi-official Microsoft blog which has with
   authors from Microsoft employees and Microsoft MVPs. I wrote some
   blogs, some about technology and some related to my life. However, my
   readers have little tolerance for posts about life. So I gave up and
   started another blog for other posts. Later I noticed that most
   bloggers on the semi-official blog have other blogs for such use
   also. Now the blog is tech-only. Several such blogs are focused on
   certain topics and direct the discussion in existing communities such
   as war, law, technology and literature, sometimes such concentration
   of topics is called blogosphere. Opinions, ideas and discussions
   around a particular subject or controversy can easily spread in
   blogospheres through trackbacks and a topic can dominate the
   discussion in several blogospheres in a period of time. Some of these
   blogospheres have great influence. First, they can revive a story
   like they did for the Trent Lott story. Second, they have much
   quicker responses to breaking news than mainstream media (Conference
   Examines Blogs' Impact on News. Nov 14, 2004). Third, some news
   stories were quickly proved false by interactive bloggers and their
   feedbacks (Macht J., Sept 27, 2004). Fourth, some blogs created by
   business companies, such as a group of blogs of Microsoft employees
   and product teams, namely MSDN blogs, became information and feedback
   centers. Business has intervened to make money from these
   blogospheres. On one hand, some bloggers make money by writing blogs
   and putting ads on their blogs, or by writing blogs about certain
   products. For example, Google's AdSense, which delivers
   content-relative ads to web pages, became ubiquitous on blogs, and
   some famous bloggers can earn a lot of money by comment some certain
   products. (Gard, L. Dec 13, 2004). On the other hand, many people
   exploit the trackback system on blogs to promote their website by
   adding links to them, and as many as thousands such link-only posts
   on MSDN blogs everyday. These blog spams made the blog service
   providers, and major search engines modified their software to
   discourage such behavior. Censorship has also been extended to
   regulate these blogospheres. For example, several war blogs written
   by soldiers were shut down under the command from officers in the
   Second Gulf War. In addition, Blogcn, a major free blog host service
   in China, was shut down for several days to apply new censorship
   system for illegal posts related to adult and political contents.
   Therefore, blog service providers such as Microsoft and Bloggers.com,
   forced their “Code of Conduct” to prevent such exploitation or abuse
   of their blog service. Another example is, some employees, such as
   Mark Jen of Google, were fired for their “improper words” on blogs
   (Crawford, K. ,February 15, 2005). . Almost 6 years after blogging
   software opened the gate of blogging, millions of bloggers stepped on
   this field. During this process, bloggers‘influence to the outside
   world increased quickly, and created their own communities, the
   blogospheres. Giving more and more social activities involved
   blogospheres, blog will become as popular as email, or even more.
