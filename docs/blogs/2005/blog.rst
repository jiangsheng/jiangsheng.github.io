   Blog, or weblog, refers to certain kind of online journal that, it is
   time-stamped articles posted on websites, usually in reverse
   chronological order. In addition, it usually enables visitors to
   leave comments on the same web page of article, trace related blogs
   between different websites, and get notification if the blog is
   updated. It can also refer to the action of writing blogs.

   In a famous blog by Rebecca Blood, she observed that Jorn Barger
   named his website, which with daily articles consisted of interesting
   links to websites and comments of these websites; as Weblog, and it
   is Peter Merholz who once broke Weblog into the phrase “we blog”.(
   Blood, R., September 7, 2000), which was shortened to “blog” during
   spreading. The number of bloggers boosted after web based blog tools,
   such as one provided by Blogger.com since 1999, enabled writing blog
   or comments online, and publishing it with a few mouse clicks. But
   blog had not much attention at that time.

   The influence of blogs was boosted by political events. After the
   beginning of War on Terrorism, while interactive blogs focused on the
   war, namely warblogs, spread and gain readership because their
   immediacy and interactivity, and anonymity of comments, while the
   reaction of mainstream media were slowed by censorship. By the spring
   of 2003, Forbes Magazine used "war blogger" in this larger sense when
   listing the "best warblogs." In the U.S. presidential election of
   2004, Blogs by celebrity, such as journalists, politicians and
   president candidates, gained public attention. Recently, Microsoft
   said that the free blogging service, called MSN Spaces, had attracted
   4.5 million users during its preliminary test phase, which began last
   December and end a few days ago. The use of the word “blog” was so
   common that, “blog” was included in the Oxford English Dictionary
   soon (Quarterly updates to OED Online, March 13, 2003). Many
   companies noticed this tendency and kicked in, deployed blogs on
   their public or private website. Several media, such as newspapers,
   magazines began to publish articles, especially editorials in the
   form of blogs. Microsoft has developed several blog systems for its
   product teams, individual staffs and customers.

    I started my first blog at September, 2003.While I had been looking
   for a web application for simplify updating my personal homepage for
   a long time, I found blog is the exact application I want. The recent
   update page in my website used to consist of paragraphs in reverse
   chronological order, with a timestamp to mark the date of update, so
   that the visitors will notice the new updates easily. Despite of its
   usability, to perform an update of my homepage, I had to find the
   proper insert-point in the page, add new paragraphs, and then use
   some FTP (file transfer protocol) software applications to upload the
   whole modified page to the web server. Soon I found guest books,
   where visitors can leave messages and internet forums, where
   registered users can start a discussion or join a discussion, are
   very useful but both of them are not eligible for a recent update
   part of my website because they are open for visitors. When I found
   that I can perform an update by filling forms online, I switched to
   writing blogs almost immediately. Soon I found my blogs were cited in
   various blogs and get comments from their readers, because the blog
   tool they used adds a link, namely *trackback*, to my blog
   automatically, and many visitors followed the link on the blogs to
   read my blog. More visitors of my blogs come from search engines,
   while my posts on internet forums or guest books did not get such
   much attention because they do not have separate web address for each
   article. Some visitors come from certain kind of automatically
   generated websites which list recently updated blogs, or *blogpolls*.

   Almost immediately after I started blogging, I was invited to write
   blog for a half-official Microsoft blog which has with authors from
   Microsoft employees and Microsoft MVPs. I wrote some blogs, some
   about technology and some related to my life. How ever, readers have
   little tolerance to posts about life, they want to read technology.
   So I gave up and started another blog for other posts. I noticed most
   bloggers on the half-official blog have other blogs for such use
   also. Now the blog is tech-only. Several Such blogs, or more like
   communities were created on certain topics and direct the discussion
   in existing communities such as war, law, technology and literature,
   sometimes it is called blogosphere. Opinions, ideas and discussions
   around a particular subject or controversy can easily spread in
   blogospheres through trackbacks and dominate the discussion of a
   topic in several blogospheres in a period of time.

    Some blogospheres have great influence. They have quicker responses
   to breaking news than mainstream media (Conference Examines Blogs'
   Impact on News. Nov 14, 2004), and some news stories were quickly
   proved false by bloggers (Macht J., Sept 27, 2004). They were also
   responsible for pushing the story of Senate Trent Lott, the
   Republican leader of the Senate at that time, into the mainstream,
   after they missed it, and caused the *RESIGN* of the Republican
   leader Senate. MSDN blog, a group of blogs of Microsoft employees and
   product teams, became the information and feedback center of
   Microsoft related technologies.

   Business kicked in soon after blogging gain readership. On one hand,
   some bloggers make money by writing blogs by putting ads on their
   blogs or talk about certain products. Google's AdSense, which deliver
   content-relative ads to pages, became ubiquitous on blogs, and some
   famous bloggers can earn a lot of money by talking about some certain
   products. (Gard, L. Dec 13, 2004). On the other hand, many people use
   the trackback system to add links to the spammer's website, as many
   as thousands posts everyday on Microsoft’s MSDN blog, and made the
   blog hosts, and major search engines modified their software to
   prevent such behavior.

   Censorships also covered blogging soon. Several war blogs written by
   soldiers were shut down under the command from officers in the Second
   Gulf War, and a major blog host service in China, blogcn, had been
   shut down until new censorship system developed to prevent illegal
   posts related to adult and political contents. Blog hosts, such as
   Microsoft and Bloggers.com, forced their “Code of Conduct” and
   consider some action to “abuse”. Some company fired employees for
   their “improper words” on blogs.

   Conclusion

   .    More and more people will start blogging, entering blogosphere,
   and try to promote themselves. Blog will become as popular as email,
   or even more. Popular.
