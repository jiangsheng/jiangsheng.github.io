<!doctype html><html><head><meta charset="UTF-8"<title>Farewell, dsoframer</head><body><p>I know, it is long overdue. Microsoft discontinued it a decade ago. And <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/en-US/127bd801-525d-41c3-8516-cac7c68ec43b/location-of-dsoframer-download?forum=csharpgeneral">Office is not meant to be embedded</a>. I even advised people to not use it in new development almost a decade ago. Then why I keep using it for so long?</p><p>Because customers don’t want changes. I work in the medical field, where some of the clients still use telnet to interface with their medical software that are probably older than I am. Once you get people hooked to a UI it is hard to change that. The fact that Microsoft discontinues dsoframer means nothing to them – once I use it, I own it. It is like Microsoft having to release an Office update for the old equation editor made by MathType 16 years ago. So I have been doing patchwork as much as I can to keep dsoframer alive. </p><p>It might be a blessing in disguise that Office 2016 finally broke dsoframer on Windows 10 in a way that I can’t fix. The control just keep calculates the scrolling sizes wrong. I have to work on a solution for customers who can accept a side-by-side UI instead of embedding Office. Shortly after I published the update Microsoft dropped the bomb that <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/windowsitpro/2018/02/01/changes-to-office-and-windows-servicing-and-support/">the MSI edition of Office is being discontinued</a>, I have to say that I am lucky to have some doctors finally start accepting the side by side UI. Maybe the rest will also get use to it now there’s no alternative.</p><p>Some issues I encountered over the years </p><p>The click-to-run edition of Office dropped the registry entries required by dsoframer to function .</p><p>.Net Programmability support is not a default install option of Office</p><p>Adobe Acrobat Reader shipped with dsoframer too, and uninstall either the reader or my app breaks the remaining one. Note to self: GuidGen on samples. </p><p>Does not open document if Office is running</p><p>Various drawing issues.</p><p>I supported embedding Word longer than the Outlook team, I am really not proud of that. </p></body></html>
