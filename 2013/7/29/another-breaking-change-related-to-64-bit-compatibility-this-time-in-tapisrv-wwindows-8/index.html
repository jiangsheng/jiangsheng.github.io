Now it seems to be Tapi's turn. In the <a class="zem_slink" title="64-bit computing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit_computing" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">64 bit</a> editions of <a class="zem_slink" title="Windows 8" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_8" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Windows 8</a> and <a class="zem_slink" title="Windows Server 2012" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Server_2012" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Windows Server 2012</a>, some TAPI providers would stop getting incoming calls due to implementation changes in the TAPI service (TAPISRV) that had to be done for 64 bit compatibility.

The problem is pretty obvious from the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms725235%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">documentation</a>, for example LINE_NEWCALL has this:

<span style="line-height:1.5;">htLine = (HTAPILINE) hLineDevice;</span>
htCall = (HTAPICALL) 0;
dwMsg = (DWORD) LINE_NEWCALL;
dwParam1 = (DWORD)(HDRVCALL) hdCall;
dwParam2 = (DWORD)(LPHTAPICALL) &amp;htCall;
dwParam3 = (DWORD) 0;

The parameters can't really be passed as DWORDs - on a 64 bit build, pointers are 64 bit in size, and a DWORD is 32 bit.

Fortunately this can be corrected fairly easily, just ignore what the documentation said and treat the DWORD parameters as DWORD_PTR, however for the end users they would need updates from TAPI providers to get TAPI working on their Windows 8 /Server 2012 machine.

<ul>
	<li>Avaya TAPI</li>
	<li>Acatel-Lucent TSP</li>
	<li>NEC TSP (for PBX NEC SL1100)</li>
	<li>Siemens HiPath TAPI 120/170 (V2 R1.66.0)</li>
