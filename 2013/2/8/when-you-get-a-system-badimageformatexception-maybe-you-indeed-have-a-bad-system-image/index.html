<!doctype html><html><head><meta charset="UTF-8"<title>When you get a System.BadImageFormatException. maybe you indeed have a bad system image.</head><body>I am getting a StackOverflowException with two functions repeating on the <a class="zem_slink" title="Call stack" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">call stack</a>, one is the constructor of System.BadImageFormatException, another is System.Environment.GetResourceStringLocal.  Since the call that throws the stack overflow is to a <a class="zem_slink" title="Web service" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">web service</a> proxy defined in the same project as the application, there isn't a 32bit/64bit mismatch here (32bit machine with every project targeting x86), unlike almost all other discussions on the internet about this exception.

After inspecting Fusion and event logs and finding nothing suspicious, I decided to treat it as a real bad image problem and reinstalled .Net. Ура! The exception went away after reinstalling.

Sometimes, the exception name isn't misleading.
